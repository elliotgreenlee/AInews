Our Sun may once have had a twin. What happened to this stellar sibling?,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20241223-the-search-for-the-suns-missing-twin," Many stars in our galaxy exist in pairs, but our Sun is a notable exception. Now scientists are finding clues that it may once have had a companion of its own. The question is, where did it go? Our Sun is a bit of an isolated nomad. Orbiting in one of the Milky Way's spiral arms, it takes us on a a journey around the galaxy roughly once every 230 million years on our lonesome. The nearest star to our Sun, Proxima Centauri, is 4.2 light-years away, so remote that it would take even the fastest spacecraft ever built more than 7,000 years to reach. Everywhere we look in our galaxy however, the star at the centre of our Solar System seems like more and more of an anomaly. Binary stars – stars that orbit the galaxy inexorably linked together as pairs – appear to be common. Recently astronomers have even spotted a pair orbiting in surprisingly close proximity to the supermassive black hole that sits at the heart of the Milky Way – a location that astrophysicists thought would cause the stars to be ripped apart from each other or squashed together by the intense gravity. In fact, discoveries of binary star systems are now so common that some scientists believe that perhaps all stars were once in binary relationships – born as pairs, each with a stellar sibling. That has led to an intriguing question: was our own Sun once a binary star too, its companion lost long ago? It's definitely a possibility, says Gongjie Li, an astronomer at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US. ""And it's very interesting."" Fortunately for us, our Sun does not have a companion today. If it did, the gravitational pull of a solar sibling could have disrupted the orbit of the Earth and the other planets, condemning our home to lurches from extreme heat to terrible cold in a way that may have been too inhospitable for life. The closest binary stars to Earth, Alpha Centauri A and B, orbit each other at about 24 times the Earth-Sun distance, or 3.6 billion miles. Suggestions that our Sun could also have a faint companion circling our Solar System today – a hypothetical star often called Nemesis – have fallen out of favour since they were first proposed in 1984 after no such star was found in multiple surveys and studies. But when our Sun first formed 4.6 billion years ago, however, it may have been a different matter. Stars form when giant clouds of dust and gas tens of light-years across cool and clump together. The material inside these nebulae – as these cocoons of gas and dust are known – collapse together under gravity into ever growing lumps. As it does so, it begins to warm up over millions of years, eventually igniting nuclear fusion to create a protostar with a disk of remnant debris spinning around it, which forms planets. In 2017, Sarah Sadavoy, an astrophysicist at Queen's University in Canada, used data from a radio survey of the Perseus molecular cloud – a stellar nursery filled with young binary star systems – to conclude that the process of star formation might preferentially form protostars in pairs. Indeed, she and her colleagues found it was so likely that they suggested all stars might form in pairs or multi-star systems. ""You get little density spikes within those cocoons, and those are able to collapse and form multiple stars, which we call a fragmentation process,"" says Sadavoy. ""If they're very far away [from each other], they might never interact. But if they're much closer, gravity has a chance to keep them bound together."" Sadavoy's work showed that it was possible that all stars once started as a binary, and while some remain bound together indefinitely, others would break apart rapidly within a million years. ""Stars live for billions of years,"" she says. ""It is a blip in the grand scheme of things. But so much happens in that blip."" That raises the question of whether the same might have been true of our Sun. There's no reason to think it wasn't, says Sadavoy. But ""if we did form with a companion, we lost it"", she says. It is likely that any companion would now be lost among the sea of stars that we see in the night sky – Sarah Sadavoy There are some tantalising clues emerging our Sun was once part of a binary system. In 2020, Amir Siraj, an astrophysicist at Harvard University in the US, suggested that a region of icy comets that surrounds our Solar System far beyond Pluto, called the Oort Cloud, might contain an imprint of this companion star. This frigid shell of ice and rock is so far away that the most distant spacecraft ever launched by humankind – Voyager 1 – will not reach it for at least another 300 years. (Read more about what the Voyager missions are teaching us about the weird space on the outskirts of our Solar System.) If our Sun did have a companion, then it would have resulted in more dwarf planets like Pluto existing in this region, says Siraj. It might also have led to a larger planet ending up here, like the hypothesised Neptune-sized world Planet Nine that some astronomers believe remains undiscovered in our Sun's outer reaches. (Read more about the mystery of Planet Nine in this article by Zaria Gorvett.) ""It's hard to produce quite as many objects in the furthest reaches of the Oort Cloud as we see"" without a companion star, says Siraj, with billions or even trillions of objects orbiting in the Oort Cloud. If an additional planet like Planet Nine were to be found, explaining how such a planet ended up so far from the Sun is ""really hard"", says Siraj, unless we invoke the disrupting gravitational hand of a companion star. ""It could boost the capture of comets and the chances of the Solar System capturing a planet,"" he says. Konstantin Batygin, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology in the US who first proposed the existence of Planet Nine in 2016 based on the clustering of distant objects, isn't so sure about the idea. ""A binary companion is by no means required to explain the Oort Cloud,"" says Batygin. ""You can fully explain the existence of the Oort Cloud just by the fact that the Sun formed in a cluster of stars, and as Jupiter and Saturn grew to their present-day masses, they ejected a bunch of objects."" Even Planet Nine can be explained just by ""passing stars in the birth cluster"", he says. However, in a recently published research paper, Batygin suggests that the inner edge of the Oort Cloud could be explained by a companion star. ""What we found by doing computer simulations is that as objects get scattered out, they start to interact with the binary companion,"" says Batygin. ""They can detach from the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn and get trapped in the inner Oort Cloud."" It might be possible to confirm if this idea is true with a new telescope in Chile, called the Vera Rubin Observatory, set to switch on next year and perform the most detailed survey ever of the night sky over the following 10 years. ""As Vera Rubin comes online and begins to really map out the structure of the Oort Cloud in greater detail, we can see if there's a clear thumbprint of the binary companion,"" says Batygin. More like this:  Another possible signature of a binary companion's impact is that our Sun is tilted very slightly, by about seven degrees, to the plane of the Solar System. A possible explanation for this is the gravitational pull of another star, which tilted our Sun off balance. ""I think the most natural explanation is the presence of a companion star early on,"" says Batygin, an effect that we see in other binary stars throughout the galaxy. But even if this early evidence does turn out to be correct, finding our Sun's missing twin may be a far more challenging prospect. It is likely that any companion would now be ""lost among the sea of stars that we see in the night sky"", says Sadavoy. However, stars born in the same region of space as our Sun might have a similar composition because they will have been forged from the same mix of gases and dust, making them all veritable siblings. In 2018, scientists identified one such a ""twin"" star of our Sun, with a similar size and chemical composition located less than 200 light-years away. Before we get too excited, however, it is worth remembering that the cloud of gas and dust in which our Sun was born also probably formed ""hundreds or thousands of stars"", says Sadavoy. All of these would have a similar composition, meaning there would be no way to know if any were our Sun's true companion. Even then, any companion of our Sun might not have been a similarly sized star. ""It could have been a [smaller] red dwarf star, or a hotter, bluer star,"" says Sadavoy. While finding and identifying our Sun's possible companion seems daunting, the prospect that it was once a binary star raises interesting implications for planets around other stars, known as exoplanets. Most notably, it would demonstrate that in our Solar System, the existence of life and the survival of our planets was not diminished by the presence of another star. ""There are many discovered exoplanetary systems that actually orbit stellar binaries,"" says Li. Some of those orbit one of the two stars, known as circumstellar systems, while others orbit both of the stars and have skies with two suns like the fictional planet Tatooine in Star Wars. These are called circumbinary systems. Sometimes we do see binary companions causing havoc with such systems, though. ""It depends on how far away the star is,"" says Li. If the star is closer in, it can ""kick the planetary orbits"" and push them into eccentric, non-circular shapes. ""In circumstellar systems, the planets could have a high eccentricity,"" says Li. ""But this may not necessarily make them unstable."" It can, however, cause the planet to experience large changes in temperature as it swings closer to and further from the star, he says. For our own planet, it seems that the possible existence of a binary companion to our Sun long ago did not hinder our own existence. And as scientists examine the furthest regions of our Solar System in ever more detail, they may well uncover more signs that it once did exist – a lasting signature waiting to be found. If it does exist it could be out there, somewhere, with a solar system all of its own. ""It might not have trailed too far behind or ahead,"" says Sadavoy. ""Or it could be on the other side of the galaxy and we would not know. ""It could be anywhere."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram."
Drug lord back in Colombia after 20 years in US jail,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 07:38:53 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwv4lez6go," One of the founders of the Medellin drug cartel has returned to Colombia after serving more than 20 years in jail in the US for drug trafficking.Fabio Ochoa Vasquez, now 67 years old, was deported by the US government and landed in Bogota on Monday a free man.Ochoa was one of the founding members of the notorious cartel and had been a senior lieutenant to infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar.The Medellin cartel dominated the cocaine trade and waged a violent campaign against the Colombian state before Escobar was killed in 1993. On his arrival in Bogota, immigration officials ran Ochoa's fingerprints through their database, the country's immigration agency said.Confirming that he is not wanted by Colombian authorities, it said that Ochoa was freed ""to be reunited with his family"".Amid a sea of reporters in the airport terminal, Ochoa was greeted by his relatives and hugged his daughter.In 2001, Ochoa was flown to the US after being arrested in Colombia in 1999 along with about 30 other alleged traffickers.He had already served a jail sentence in Colombia in the early 90s for his role as one of bosses of the Medellin cartel. Along with his brothers, he was the first major trafficker to surrender under a programme that protected cartel members from extradition to the US if they pleaded guilty to minor offences in Colombia.Ochoa and his brothers were released from prison in 1996, but Ochoa was arrested once again during the so-called Millennium operation over his involvement in the cocaine smuggling business in the US in the late 1990s.In 2003, Ochoa was sentenced to more than 30 years in a US court for his involvement in the cartel that brought an average of 30 tonnes of cocaine into the US each month between 1997 and 1999. During the 1980s, he was one of the top operators in Escobar's Medellin ring, a supplier in its prime of 80% of the US cocaine market.The defunct Medellin cartel, along with the Cali cartel, was one of the most powerful and feared drug networks of the 1980s.Its violent campaigns of bombings and assassinations led to extraditions of drugs suspects between Colombia and the US to be suspended, before being resumed in 1997."
The US town where it's the law to own a gun,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 00:47:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx505p5n59o," Kennesaw, Georgia, has all the small-town fixings one might imagine in the American South. There's the smell of baked biscuits wafting from Honeysuckle Biscuits & Bakery and the rumble of a nearby railroad train. It's the kind of place where newlyweds leave hand-written thank-you cards in coffee shops, praising the ""cozy"" atmosphere.But there's another aspect of Kennesaw that some might find surprising – a city law from the 1980s that legally requires residents to own guns and ammo.""It's not like you go around wearing it on your hip like the Wild Wild West,"" said Derek Easterling, the town's three-term mayor and self-described ""retired Navy guy"".""We're not going to go knock on your door and say, 'Let me see your weapon.'""Kennesaw's gun law plainly states: ""In order to provide for and protect the safety, security and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants, every head of household residing in city limits is required to maintain a firearm, together with ammunition.""Residents with mental or physical disabilities, felony convictions, or conflicting religious beliefs are exempt from the law.To Mayor Easterling's knowledge, and that of multiple local officials, there have been no prosecutions or arrests made for violating Article II, Sec 34-21, which came into law in 1982.And no one that the BBC spoke to could say what the penalty would be for being found in violation.Still, the mayor insisted: ""It's not a symbolic law. I'm not into things just for show."" For some, the law is a source of pride, a nod to the city's embrace of gun culture.For others, it's a source of embarrassment, a page in a chapter of history they wish to move beyond.But the main belief amongst the townsfolk about the gun law is that it keeps Kennesaw safe.Patrons eating pepperoni slices at the local pizza parlour will propose: ""If anything, criminals need to be concerned, because if they break into your home, and you're there, they don't know what you got.""There were no murders in 2023, according to Kennesaw Police Department data, but there were two gun-involved suicides.Blake Weatherby, a groundskeeper at the Kennesaw First Baptist Church, has different thoughts on why violent crime might be low.""It's the attitude behind the guns here in Kennesaw that keep the gun crimes down, not the guns,"" Mr Weatherby said.""It doesn't matter if it's a gun or a fork or a fist or a high heel shoe. We protect ourselves and our neighbours."" Pat Ferris, who joined Kennesaw's city council in 1984, two years after the law was passed, said the law was created to be ""more of a political statement than anything"".After Morton Grove, Illinois, became the first US city to ban gun ownership, Kennesaw became the first city to require it, triggering national news headlines.A 1982 opinion piece by the New York Times described Kennesaw officials as ""jovial"" over the law's passage but noted that ""Yankee criminologists"" were not.Penthouse Magazine ran the story on its cover page with the words Gun Town USA: An American Town Where It's Illegal Not to Own a Gun printed over an image of a bikini-clad blonde woman.Similar gun laws have been passed in at least five cities, including Gun Barrel City, Texas and Virgin, Utah.In the 40 years since Kennesaw's gun law was passed, Mr Ferris said, its existence has mostly faded from consciousness.""I don't know how many people even know that the ordinance exists,"" he said. The same year the gun law took effect, Mr Weatherby, the church groundskeeper, was born.He recalled a childhood where his dad would half-jokingly tell him: ""I don't care if you don't like guns, it's the law.""""I was taught that if you're a man, you've got to own a gun,"" he said.Now 42, he was 12 years old the first time he fired a weapon.""I almost dropped it because it scared me so bad,"" he said.Mr Weatherby owned over 20 guns at one point but said now he doesn't own any. He sold them over the years – including the one his dad left him when he died in 2005 – to overcome hard times.""I needed gas more than guns,"" he said.One place he could've gone to sell his firearms is the Deercreek Gun Shop located on Kennesaw's Main Street.James Rabun, 36, has been working at the gun store ever since he graduated high school.It's the family business, he said, opened by his dad and grandad, both of whom can still be found there today; his dad in the back restoring firearms, his grandad in the front relaxing in a rocking chair.For obvious reasons, Mr Rabun is a fan of Kennesaw's gun law. It's good for business.""The cool thing about firearms"", he said with earnest enthusiasm, ""is that people buy them for self-defence, but a lot of people like them like artwork or like bitcoin – things of scarcity.""Among the dozens and dozens of weapons hanging on the wall for sale are double barrel black powder shotguns – akin to a musket – and a few ""they-don't-make-these-anymore"" Winchester rifles from the 1800s. In Kennesaw, gun fandom has a broad reach that extends beyond gun shop owners and middle-aged men.Cris Welsh, a mother of two teenaged daughters, is unabashed about her gun ownership. She hunts, is a member at a gun club, and shoots at the local gun range with her two girls.""I'm a gun owner"", she admitted, listing off her inventory which includes ""a Ruger carry pistol, a Beretta, a Glock, and about half a dozen shotguns"".However, Ms Welsh is not fond of Kennesaw's gun law.""I'm embarrassed when I hear people talk about the gun law,"" Ms Welsh said. ""It's just an old Kennesaw thing to hang onto.""She wished that when outsiders thought of the city, they called to mind the parks and schools and community values – not the gun law ""that makes people uncomfortable"".""There's so much more to Kennesaw,"" she said.City council member Madelyn Orochena agrees that the law is ""something that people would prefer not to advertise"".""It's just a weird little factoid about our community,"" she said.""Residents will either roll their eyes in a bit of shame or laugh along about it."""
Brazil shuts BYD factory site over 'slavery' conditions,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 07:27:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xj9jp57r2o," Brazilian authorities have halted the construction of a factory for Chinese electric vehicle (EV) giant BYD, saying workers lived in conditions comparable to ""slavery"".More than 160 workers have been rescued in Brazil's northeastern state of Bahia, according to a statement from the Public Labour Prosecutor's Office (MPT).They were allegedly put in a ""degrading"" environment and had their passports and salaries withheld by a building company.BYD said in a statement that it had cut ties with the firm involved and remained committed to a ""full compliance with Brazilian legislation"". The factory was scheduled to be operational by March 2025, and was set to be BYD's first EV plant outside of Asia.The workers, hired by Jinjiang Construction Brazil, lived in four facilities in Camaçari city.At one such facility, workers were made to sleep on beds without mattresses, according to prosecutors. Each bathroom was also shared among 31 workers, forcing them to get up extremely early in order to be ready for work.""The conditions found in the lodgings revealed an alarming picture of precariousness and degradation,"" the MPT said.""Slavery-like conditions"", as defined by Brazilian law, include debt bondage and work that violates human dignity.The MPT added that the situation also constitutes ""forced labour"", as many workers had their wages withheld and faced excessive costs for terminating their contracts.BYD said affected workers had been moved to hotels.It added that it had conducted a ""detailed review"" of the working and living conditions for subcontracted employees, and asked on ""several occasions"" for the construction firm to make improvements. BYD, short for Build Your Dreams, is one of the world's largest EV makers.It sold more electric vehicles than Elon Musk's Tesla in the last three months of 2023, as the two battled for top spot in the sector.The company has also been expanding its foothold in Brazil, which is its largest overseas market by a wide margin.It first opened a factory in São Paulo in 2015, producing chassis for electric buses. Last year, it announced that it would invest 3 billion reais ($484.2m) in Brazil to build an EV manufacturing plant.EV sales in China have been boosted by government subsidies. which encourage consumers to trade their petrol-powered cars for EVs or hybrids. But there is a growing backlash abroad against what some see as the Chinese government's unfair support for domestic car makers.Major markets like the US and EU have placed tariffs on EVs from China, with more tariffs expected during the incoming administration of US president-elect Donald Trump."
The famous Christmas carol inspiring Ukraine's defenders,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 05:55:37 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyxplxry93o," Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine is the birthplace of one of the world's favourite carols, the Carol of the Bells.But there are few signs of Christmas in the city this year. Just a dusting of snow on deserted streets and skeletal buildings -  and the constant sound of heavy shelling.Pokrovsk is Russia's next target. Its troops are now less than two miles (three kilometres) from the city centre.And it's not just buildings and homes that are being destroyed. Ukraine accuses Russia of trying to erase its cultural identity too – including its associations with that well-known carol.Most of Pokrovsk's population has already fled. The gas supply's been turned off and many homes are without electricity and water. Those who remain, like 59-year-old Ihor,  only break cover to find the bare essentials. He says it's like living on a powder keg – you never know when or where the next shell will land.Oksana, 43, says she's too frightened to leave her home, but goes out during a lull in the shelling to find wood and coal to keep warm.She tells me she hopes Ukraine's armed forces can hold on to the city, but she thinks that's unlikely. Pokrovsk, she says, will probably fall. The city has already prepared for the worst. The statue of its famous composer, Mykola Leontovych, has already been removed. The music school that bore his name now lies boarded up and empty.Leontovych may not be well known in the West. But the tune he composed is familiar around the world - with its chime-like vocals. It's thought that Leontovych wrote the early scores of the composition, based on a Ukrainian folk chant, while he was living and working in Pokrovsk between 1904 and 1908. In Ukraine it's known as Shchedryk. To most of the world it became known as the Carol of the Bells, after American composer Peter Wilhousky wrote English lyrics for the song. The tune's use in the Hollywood film Home Alone helped boost its popularity.Viktoria Ametova calls it ""a masterpiece - the signature song of Pokrovsk"". She too was until recently teaching music in the city, in the school that bore Leontovych's name.She's now moved to the relative safety of Dnipro. It's where many of Pokrovsk's former residents are still trying to keep the memories of their former home alive.Beneath a salvaged portrait of Leontovych, Viktoria watches as 13-year-old Anna Hasych strikes the familiar chords of the carol on a piano. The Hasych family fled Pokrovsk this summer. But they're determined not to forget the place they still call home. Anna's mother, Yulia, says she's glad to see her daughters practising  Shchedryk. ""We won't forget the history of our town,"" she says.For Anna, the tune brings back memories. ""When I played it at home it seemed happy. It reminded me of winter and Christmas,"" she says. ""Now it's more of a sad song to me because it reminds me of home, and I really want to go back.""But for one Ukrainian military band, Shchedryk has become a song to inspire resistance. They're even playing it in the trenches – using weapons as improvised instruments.They may be musicians, but their commander reminds me that they're soldiers first. All have spent time on the front line. Colonel Bohdan Zadorozhnyy, the head of the band and its conductor, says the song helps lifts soldiers spirits. ""Those beats and rhythms cheer up the guys on the front line and inspire them to fight,"" he says.22-year-old Roman uses a rocket launcher casing, filled with rice, to shake vigorously in time with the music. Shchedryk, he says, is the ""pride of our country, it's freedom, it's in our souls, I get goosebumps from this song"". Colonel Zadorozhnyy says Shchedryk shows that Ukraine is a civilised nation, now at war, fighting for its identity. Pokrovsk may well fall into Russian hands. But its people are doing all they can to preserve their culture and identity.The director of Pokrovsk's History Museum, Angelina Rozhkova, has already salvaged and transferred most of its prized possessions to safety – including artefacts from Leontovych's life in Pokrovsk. Russia, she says, doesn't just want to take Ukraine's territory – ""It wants to destroy our culture and everything precious to us"".Angelina says the people of Pokrovsk understand they may never go back, ""but our heart and souls do not accept that"". Hence they're doing everything they can to preserve the past. The new motto is ""keeping and saving, equals winning"".It's hard to say you're winning when your city's being destroyed. But its people, like Leontovych's music, are displaying extraordinary resilience.Leontovych's life came to an abrupt end in 1921 when he was shot by a Soviet agent. His composition had become a symbol for the fight for Ukraine's independence. It still is.Additional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Anastasiia Levchenko"
Celebrity capybara enjoys family Christmas at home,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 06:36:04 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8y35npyrvo," Cinnamon the capybara had fan mail from around the world after her recent great escape from a Shropshire zoo, but Christmas Day will be spent away from the headlines and her adoring public, in the privacy of her enclosure.The adventurous one-year-old rodent will remain at home with her family, including her parents and brother Churro.Christmas Day at  Hoo Zoo and Dinosaur World in Telford is a special time for the keepers, who get to spend quality time with their favourite creatures while the site is closed.Like many youngsters, Cinnamon will have presents, treats and games on Christmas Day - while avoiding too much sugar. News of Cinnamon's escape spread across the world in September, with media reports as far away as North America.Animal lovers avidly followed her story during the week she was on the run before she was found in a conservation area near the zoo.Now world-famous, Cinnamon and her big adventure have sparked internet memes, merchandise, a song, and a children's book, which will raise money for the zoo. Since her escape, zoo keepers have received emails from the public concerned for her welfare and who are checking on how she is. Zoo owner Will Dorrell said letters have also arrived from across the world, including Australia, America and Canada.The keepers have also been sent drawings and paintings of Cinnamon and are ready to receive more artwork for the rodent as the holidays approach, so there may be presents for Cinnamon when she wakes up on Christmas Day. Christmas dinner in the capybara enclosure will include sweet potato on the menu, which is Cinnamon's favourite food.She is also partial to ""a bit of banana"", but isn't allowed too much of it, because it is high in sugar.Cinnamon had her first birthday while she was on the run but celebrated it back at the zoo in October after she was found and brought home.Keepers who made a birthday cake for her took her favourite food, steamed it, and mashed it, and shaped it into a cake before they wrapped it in banana leaves and placed it in a pumpkin for her to feast on.""She loved it,"" Dorrell said.He admits, however, that it did look ""a bit gross"".Cinnamon had already turned one by then, but on the day of her official birthday party in October, about 500 people were at the zoo to join in the celebrations. All the animals at Hoo Zoo get treats at Christmas that are mainly food-based, Dorrell said.The keepers place food in treat balls, similar to those used for horses, so they can look for them and play with them to get the morsels out.Dorrell said all the animals were treated equally.""All of the animals get treats, and Cinnamon and all the capybaras get the same,"" he said.""It's difficult not to single her out because of how much fuss she caused.""It's a bit like children.""On Christmas Day, keepers still get up early to be at the zoo for 05:00 GMT, but they get to enjoy spending time with the animals while the site is shut to visitors. That special time when the zoo is closed includes Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day, before it reopens on 27 December, but it is unlikely the animals will get together for the festivities.""I don't think it's too much of a party from the animals' point of view,"" Dorrell said.""They are pretty nonplussed about the whole thing.""He said there would be a Christmas party atmosphere from 27 December, when the zoo reopens to the public, and it may rub off on the animals then. But what will the new year bring for Cinnamon, and has she got a taste for adventure?Since her escape, the gate system has been changed, Dorrell said.He thinks she made a break for it in the space of about 90 seconds while the gates were open after a keeper entered the enclosure with a tractor to mow it.The keeper involved was mortified, Dorrell said, and had never made that mistake before.But the tractor also backfired at the time, he added, and it might have startled Cinnamon, who then made a bolt for it.Or she could have seen the gate open and taken her chance.In any case, Dorrell said she did not travel far - only went about 250 metres from her habitat.For Cinnamon, it may be that there is no place like home.

"As Biden commutes death row sentences, how Trump plans to expand executions","Tue, 24 Dec 2024 00:59:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjd0j0y34wo," With just weeks left in office, US President Joe Biden has commuted the sentences of 37 of 40 federal death row inmates - potentially thwarting President-elect Donald Trump's plans to expand federal executions during his upcoming administration. Biden's move was swiftly condemned by Republicans, with some accusing the president of siding with criminals over law-abiding Americans. Federal executions were relatively rare before Trump's first term in office, which finished with a flurry of executions that ended a 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions amid a presidential transition.He has vowed to resume the practice when he returns to the White House in January, setting the stage for possible legal battles early in the administration. Here's what we know.  On Monday, Biden commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 death row inmates, switching their penalty to life without parole. Only three inmates were left to face the death penalty, including convicted Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Robert Bowers, who was sentenced to death for killing 11 worshippers and wounding seven during a shooting at a the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. The third, Dylann Roof, was sentenced to death in 2017 for a mass shooting that left nine black parishioners dead at the Mother Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. While the move was widely praised by human rights groups such as Amnesty International, it was quickly condemned by some Republicans, as well as Trump's transition team and political allies. In a statement, Trump communications director Steven Cheung said that ""these are among the worst killers in the world and this abhorrent decision by Joe Biden is a slap in the face to the victims, their families, and their loved ones.""President Trump stands for the rule of law, which will return when he is back in the White House,"" he added. Trump cannot undo the commutations when he returns to the White House next month.Texas Republican Chip Roy posted on X that the decision was ""unconscionable"" and an abuse of power ""to carry out a miscarriage of justice"". Another Republican, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, said that ""when given the choice between law-abiding Americans or criminals, Joe Biden and the Democrats choose criminals every time."" Some family members also expressed anger. On Facebook, Heather Turner - whose mother was killed in a 2017 bank robbery - called the commutations a ""gross abuse of power"". ""At no point did the president consider the victims,"" she wrote. ""He, and his supporters, have blood on their hands.""The commutations do not apply to the approximately 2,200 death row inmates convicted by state courts, over which the president holds no authority. Over the course of his election campaign, Trump vowed to resume federal executions and make more people eligible to receive the death penalty, including those convicted of raping children or drug and human-trafficking cases, as well as migrants who kill US citizens or police officers. ""These are terrible, terrible, horrible people who are responsible for death, carnage and crime all over the country,"" Trump said when he announced his presidential candidacy in 2022. ""We're going to be asking everyone who sells drugs, gets caught, to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts,"" he added. There are more than 40 federal laws that can, in theory, result in the death penalty, ranging from murders committed during a drug-related shooting to genocide. Almost all - with the exception of espionage and treason - explicitly involve the death of a victim. Trump, however, has provided few details on how he plans to accomplish his campaign pledge. Despite the lack of clarity, Trump's vows to expand the federal death penalty have elicited strong warnings from human rights advocates.In an 11 December statement, for example, the American Civil Liberties Union said Trump's ""chilling"" plans amount to an expansion of the ""killing spree he initiated in the final six months of his first presidency"".""He's already shown us that he will act on these promises,"" the statement said. The inmates executed during the waning days of Trump's first administration included Lisa Montgomery, the first woman executed by the federal government since 1953, and Lezmond Mitchell, the only Native American on federal death row.  US media reported that Trump cannot reverse Biden's commutations.Trump's efforts to expand the death penalty to crimes that do not involve murder are likely to face legal challenges. In 2008, for example, the Supreme Court ruled that those convicted of raping children cannot be executed, adding that it's unclear if the death penalty could be applied to crimes in which a victim is not killed. According to the National Registry of Exonerations, cases with child victims are particularly prone to wrongful convictions, can be ""extremely emotional"" and pit family members against one another. Any further expansion of crimes that are eligible for the federal death penalty would require Congress to act and change the law. In 2024, two bills - both sponsored by Florida Republican and Trump ally Anna Paulina Luna - sought to expand the use of capital offences to include possession of child pornography, as well as the trafficking, exploitation and abuse of children. Both failed to pass in the House of Representatives.  Trump is also unlikely to be able to quickly re-populate the pool of federal death row inmates, as most death penalty cases take years and are subject to lengthy appeals processes. While he does not have any direct authority over state executions, some experts have warned that Trump's pro-death penalty stance may trigger more executions at a state level. ""His rhetoric can and has spurred draconian measures and attitudes by leaders in states on several issues, including in the context of the criminal legal system,"" Yasmin Cader, a deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union and director of the Trone Center for Justice and Equality told CNN. In addition to the federal government and US military, 27 US states still have the death penalty on the books. A Gallup poll conducted in October found that a slim majority of Americans - 53% - support the death penalty for convicted murderers, up from 50% a year before. "
Chinese man in school attack gets suspended death sentence,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 04:52:45 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q04wly3nko," A Chinese court has handed a suspended death sentence to a man who injured over a dozen children by ramming his car into a crowd outside a primary school in central China.Thirty people, including 18 schoolchildren, were hurt in the incident in Changde City on 19 November. It was the third attack on a crowd in China in the span of one week.The suspended death sentence for Huang Wen could be commuted to life imprisonment if he does not commit another crime in the next two years.The ruling however sparked criticism online, with some social media users accusing the court of being lenient on Huang. In a statement, the court said Huang carried out the attack to vent his anger after dealing with investment losses and family conflict.The sentencing marked the first time the exact number of injuries from the Changde City incident was known. Many posts about it have been scrubbed from social media.Just days before, a man who was reportedly unhappy over his divorce settlement, ploughed his car into a crowd in Zhuhai, killing 35 people.Some observers have described such attacks as acts of vengeance against society. Others say these incidents underscore some people's pent-up frustrations over China's economy.""Why does he deserve a suspension?"" one Weibo user said of Huang.""Such vicious cases need to be dealt with seriously and swiftly for deterrence,"" another commented.Videos that circulated immediately after the attack showed children lying on the ground, others fleeing in panic, and an angry pedestrian banging on Huang's car with a snow shovel while he was still inside.The court said Huang's actions at that time reflected the ""extremely severe criminal circumstances"" he was in.As part of his sentence, Huang was also stripped of political rights for life."

Spacecraft attempts closest-ever approach to Sun,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 00:10:27 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q7lnyw25wo," A Nasa spacecraft is attempting to make history with the closest-ever approach to the Sun.The Parker Solar Probe is plunging into our star's outer atmosphere, enduring brutal temperatures and extreme radiation.It is out of communication for several days during this burning hot fly-by and scientists will be waiting for a signal, expected at 05:00 GMT on 28 December, to see if it has survived.The hope is the probe could help us to better understand how the Sun works. Dr Nicola Fox, head of science at Nasa, told BBC News: ""For centuries, people have studied the Sun, but you don't experience the atmosphere of a place until you actually go visit it.""And so we can't really experience the atmosphere of our star unless we fly through it."" Parker Solar Probe launched in 2018, heading to the centre of our solar system.It has already swept past the Sun 21 times, getting ever nearer, but the Christmas Eve visit is record-breaking.At its closest approach, the probe is 3.8 million miles (6.2 million km) from our star's surface.This might not sound that close, but Nasa's Nicola Fox puts it into perspective: ""We are 93 million miles away from the Sun, so if I put the Sun and the Earth one metre apart, Parker Solar Probe is four centimetres from the Sun - so that's close.""The probe will have to endure temperatures of 1,400C and radiation that could frazzle the onboard electronics.It is protected by a 11.5cm (4.5 inches) thick carbon-composite shield but the spacecraft's tactic is to get in and out fast.In fact, it will be moving faster than any human-made object, hurtling at 430,000mph - the equivalent of flying from London to New York in less than 30 seconds. Parker's speed comes from the immense gravitational pull it feels as it falls towards the Sun. So why go to all this effort to ""touch"" the Sun?Scientists hope that as the spacecraft passes through our star's outer atmosphere - its corona - it will solve a long standing mystery.""The corona is really, really hot, and we have no idea why,"" explains Dr Jenifer Millard, an astronomer at Fifth Star Labs in Wales.""The surface of the Sun is about 6,000C or so, but the corona, this tenuous outer atmosphere that you can see during solar eclipses, reaches millions of degrees - and that is further away from the Sun. So how is that atmosphere getting hotter?""The mission should also help scientists to better understand solar wind - the constant stream of charged particles bursting out from the corona.When these particles interact with the Earth's magnetic field the sky lights up with dazzling auroras.But this so-called space weather can cause problems too, knocking out power grids, electronics and communication systems.""Understanding the Sun, its activity, space weather, the solar wind, is so important to our everyday lives on Earth,"" says Dr Millard. Nasa scientists face an anxious wait over Christmas while the spacecraft is out of touch with Earth.Nicola Fox says that as soon as a signal is beamed back home, the team will text her a green heart to let her know the probe is OK.She admits she is nervous about the audacious attempt, but she has faith in the probe.""I will worry about the spacecraft. But we really have designed it to withstand all of these brutal, brutal conditions. It's a tough, tough little spacecraft.""If it survives this challenge, the probe will continue its mission around the Sun into the future."
Person caught in train doors pulled along platform,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 05:59:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vkxd07n7lo," An investigation has been launched after a passenger's hand became trapped in the closing doors of an Elizabeth line train as it was leaving London's Ealing Broadway station.The incident on 24 November saw the passenger having to run alongside the train before they were freed by a member of staff who was working on the platform.The driver was alerted to what was happening by other rail users, and the train stopped after moving approximately 17m (56 ft). The passenger reportedly suffered minor injuries.The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said it would look into what happened. Transport for London (TfL) said it was sorry the customer ""experienced this distressing incident"".  Among the issues the RAIB said it would consider are the actions of those involved and the arrangements in place to manage and control the risks associated with passengers getting on and off Elizabeth line trains.A TfL spokesperson said the operator of the service, MTR-Elizabeth line, is currently carrying out a thorough investigation into the incident which happened just after midnight.The spokesperson said: ""We will always strive to learn from incidents and improve operational safety.""MTR-Elizabeth line is fully co-operating with the RAIB to establish the root cause of this incident to determine what steps they can take to avoid any further events of this nature and to share learnings with the industry.""While serious injuries on our network are rare, we are undertaking a huge range of work aimed eradicating such incidents and making travelling even safer for everyone.""In June 2023 the RAIB investigated after two people were dragged along London Underground platforms by trains when their coats got stuck in the train doors.The incidents happened at Archway and Chalk Farm stations on the Northern line.The passenger at Archway was seriously injured after being dragged along the platform for about 2m (6.5ft) when their coat became trapped in the doors of a northbound Northern line train. In its report into the incidents the RAIB recommended that London Underground should look at reducing the risk of a passenger becoming trapped and dragged along by a departing train.This could include technology that can detect when thin objects, such as fingers, straps or clothing, become trapped in train doors and when something is being dragged along by the departing train.It said Tube bosses should consider modifying door seals to make it easier for small, trapped objects, such as clothing and straps to be pulled free from closed doors. The board also said London Underground should review the current minimum automatic train dwell times to determine if passengers have sufficient time to safely get on or off trains.TfL told BBC London it is taking action to drive improvements to reduce risk in this area, including infrastructure changes, technology improvements, and more training for station colleagues and train operators. It added it is also developing plans to trial technology to help reduce risks and it is talking to other metros and rail operators in the UK and worldwide to share how they manage risks. Concerns have previously been raised about passenger safety on the Elizabeth line at Ealing Broadway due to the gap between the platform and the train.In July the mayor of London apologised to several Elizabeth line passengers who were seriously injured using trains at the station and said work was being done to make sure the high gap would be fixed.Three passengers told BBC London they had been hurt using the service at Ealing Broadway station because the gap between the platform and trains is too big.Sadiq Khan said he was ""shocked"" to see reports on BBC London of those injured, adding: ""I'm really sorry. You should not be injured going about your daily business.""At the time TfL and Network Rail both said they were ""sorry"" some passengers had sustained injuries and safety was their ""priority"".The £18.8bn Elizabeth line opened in May 2022 and links Reading and Essex via central London.

Why 2024 was Prince William's 'annus horribilis',"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 02:24:08 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7kxlg3v82o," Listen to Daniela read this articleThere is a festive chill at Sandringham on Christmas Day morning - especially when you find yourself standing outside St Mary Magdalene Church at 5am, as I often have in my years as a royal correspondent.Last year I watched as King Charles and Queen Camilla led the royal party to church on Christmas Day, followed by the Prince and Princess of Wales, holding the hands of their children as they spoke to the crowds.The Princess kept a firm grip on playful Prince Louis as they left church, and they were given Christmas cards and presents by well wishers, along with dozens of flowers.I could never have predicted that this was the last time we would see her in person for more than six months. I was expecting to head to Italy with the couple on a royal tour, but she wouldn't join the Royal Family on another official engagement until Trooping the Colour in June. On 16 January, the Princess of Wales was admitted to hospital for major abdominal surgery. At the end of March, she went public with her cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy.For her husband, it was the start of a year that he would go on to call ""the hardest of his life"". It throws up memories of Queen Elizabeth's own ""sombre year"" of 1992 when there were multiple marriage breakdowns within the family and a major fire. At the time she described it with the now infamous phrase, ""annus horribilis"".In 2024, Prince William faced not only his wife's ill health, but the King's cancer diagnosis too, and always there in the background was the apparently unresolved conflict with his brother Prince Harry. But it was also a year in which certain aspects of Prince William's approach were cemented - family came first, the school run was prioritised. For the Prince of Wales, this time of turbulence appears to have reinforced what matters to him most.Along the way, however, it has also become evident what kind of senior royal William wants to be. We've seen more of his apprenticeship as a global statesman, especially during the 80th anniversary of D-Day on a stage alongside world leaders - but the William way has also left some questioning certain choices he has made. On 27 February, the Prince of Wales was due to give a reading at the thanksgiving service for the late King Constantine of Greece at St George's Chapel in Windsor. The illustrious guest list included European royalty.Around an hour before the service was due to begin, however, Kensington Palace announced that the Prince would be unable to attend due to a ""personal matter"". There were reassuring words from the Prince's team that there was ""nothing to panic about"" but it was highly unusual.Around this time, the Princess was given the news that cancerous cells had been discovered in post-operative tests. Over the next three weeks, the couple told the children what was happening and had time to deal with their questions privately before going public. ""I think what was remarkable was just how hard it was for the Prince of Wales at the start of the year,"" says a friend of the Prince. ""His wife had gone in for major surgery and it became worse than expected. Then there was, 'How do I tell my three children that Mummy is ill?'""All of this was happening against the backdrop of the King's own cancer treatment, which he made public on 5 February.""At a time when he was trying to protect his wife and children, he had that terrible thought that that if his father dies then everything changes,"" says the friend.Several people who know the Prince personally or have worked with him this year told me that the spotlight on what was wrong with his wife took its toll on both William and Catherine.""He was having to operate against the backdrop of the entire world questioning what was happening to his wife,"" one friend told me. With his father largely out of action for several weeks and the Princess away from public duty, the royal diary was looking stretched. Prince William was adamant that public duty would have to wait until the situation at home was more settled.It offered a hint of Prince William's way of doing things. Yes, he understood that his was a life where duty and service are expected. But for him, a man who had experienced immense loss at a young age, his wife and children were most important of all. There were two other important factors at home that helped the Prince of Wales support his wife and children – his in-laws, the Middletons; and living in Windsor.When the Princess made her public announcement about her diagnosis, the message was posted on royal social media accounts, and one of the first people to publicly respond was her brother James.Alongside a childhood holiday photo of himself and his sister, he wrote: ""Over the years, we have climbed many mountains together. As a family, we will climb this one with you too."" Together with his sister Pippa and parents Carole and Michael, the family became key to keeping life as normal as possible for the royal children. People living locally reported seeing Carole Middleton, who lives 30 miles away in Bucklebury, Berkshire, regularly driving in and out of Windsor Castle.And when the Princess's surgery prevented her from driving, it was her mother who often drove her daughter to school to collect the three children.The decision to move from Kensington Palace to Windsor Castle in 2022 also proved timely.""Windsor has been a sanctuary. It has provided the protection and privacy the family needed this year,"" said a friend. The family live in Adelaide Cottage, a four-bedroom house within the Castle grounds that is secluded enough to give the family freedom that Kensington Palace, which is located in central London, could not.Snatched photos show the Prince of Wales using an electric scooter to get around the grounds. When on royal duty, he would occasionally reveal a snippet about life at home, such as his continued devotion to Aston Villa FC, or a favoured film or TV series – earlier this year he enjoyed action film The Fall Guy and more recently he and the Princess watched spy thriller series Black Doves on Netflix.He has also taken his children to football matches at local clubs and both he and the Princess have continued to be part of school life at Lambrook, the private school in Berkshire that their children attend. During her treatment, the Princess was still able to be on the sidelines during sports days. All of this appears to have pushed other personal issues right down the Prince's agenda.The rancour between William and Harry is said to remain. Harry has visited the UK over the past 12 months but is not believed to have met his brother. They are thought to have not spoken to one another in around two years. There have been new controversies around Prince Andrew in recent months too, including revelations about his links to Chinese businessman Yang Tengbo, who was barred from the UK after concerns about national security risks. Prince Andrew has said that he had ceased contact with Mr Yang.But the prince did not attend the Royal Family's traditional pre-Christmas lunch.Such matters will have been dealt with by the King but, as heir to the throne, William's voice in family matters is increasingly significant.Robert Hardman, journalist and author of Charles III: New King. New Court. The Inside Story, says the relationship between Charles and his eldest son ""has reached a new level of understanding"".""We still have a tendency to look at William as the kid, the apprentice, the understudy,"" he says. ""But he's now been a front rank royal for 10 years. He's been around the block more than many current heads of State."" Unusually, much of what the Prince has said about his year has come directly from him rather than via formal statements or briefings.During his visit to South Africa in November for the Earthshot Prize, the Prince's environmental project, he spoke about his passion for the cause but also about the struggles of 2024.""From a family point of view, it's been brutal,"" he told the group of us who had travelled to Cape Town. For someone who has been guarded in the past, his language was surprisingly frank.His demeanour was open and positive too, clearly energised by Earthshot and being back in Africa, but he a gave a glimpse into how conflicted he was when he viewed his role as Prince of Wales.""It's a tricky one,"" he said. ""Do I like more responsibility? No. Do I like the freedom that I can build something like Earthshot, then yes."" What struck me the most after spending almost a week in Cape Town was how he framed his outlook on the modern monarchy, saying he wanted to do the job with a ""smaller R in Royal"".""I'm trying to do it differently,"" he admitted, ""and I'm trying to do it for my generation.""What he meant was not doing things in the same way as his father and grandmother.Charles and William ""are different characters"", observes Robert Hardman. ""The King is more intellectually curious, and spiritually and theologically engaged. These areas aren't of deep interest to William.""The tone of their communication is different. The King remains fairly traditional. William has his own way of doing things."" Some have questioned the William way. One critic, Graham Smith, chief executive of the anti-monarchy group Republic, argues against the Prince's decision to focus his efforts on the issue of homelessness.""[It is] crass and hypocritical of William to get involved in it, given the excessive wealth we gift him,"" he argues.However, Mr Hardman disputes the notion that William's involvement in projects like this are inappropriate. ""I think William is currently a more conventional Prince of Wales than his father was at this age. Prince Charles was a more radical heir to the throne.""The creation of the Prince's Trust sounded alarm bells at Buckingham Palace and Downing Street. William isn't ringing alarm bells."" Prince William has far fewer patronages than his father. The King currently has 669 – many maintained from his 70 years as heir to the throne. Prince William's slimline, more focused approach leaves him with around 30.It is a deliberate strategy: fewer projects but higher impact in the hope of bringing about social change. Those who have worked closely with him this year praise this approach.""His contribution is unbelievable,"" said Hannah Jones, the CEO of the Earthshot Prize. ""He has set the vision.""But that bold action comes with more risk. Last month, I travelled to Newport in South Wales with the Prince to meet those working on his homelessness project in the city. It was 10 months since his wife's cancer diagnosis, her chemotherapy was complete and William seemed to me to be less burdened by life.He was in listening mode, and spoke to dozens of people. In some of the conversations, it struck me how many ventured into the political.The Prince told the project team to think differently, to be disruptors and challenge the way things had always been done.""We drive in a very non-political lane,"" a royal source told me. ""We use our platform to convene and shine the spotlight on a societal issue and that remains unchanged. We are feeling bullish about what we can achieve even in really hard circumstances."" In the years ahead William will no doubt face further challenges around his role. In this current age of social media, for example, deference and respect for monarchy isn't the mood in the room.But it is clear from his public work that he doesn't view his future as one filled with plaque unveilings and handshaking.""I have to be seen to be believed,"" is a quote attributed to his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. For her grandson, the approach is more: ""I have to be seen to be making a difference."" Through 2024, he has ticked off meetings with many world leaders from the Emperor of Japan to the President of South Africa rounded off by the US president-elect, cementing his role on the global stage, promoting the UK with a touch of soft diplomacy.Next November, the COP climate summit is being held in Brazil and the Prince is ""looking forward to playing a role there"". An Earthshot Prize in Brazil may be a possibility too.Ultimately, the development of Prince William as family man-meets-global statesman is ongoing - and he's looking increasingly comfortable juggling both roles.Top picture credit: Getty Images BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

Watch: Hawaii's Kilauea volcano sends lava gushing to the surface in latest eruption,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 19:37:54 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c04719lper6t,
Israel confirms it killed Hamas leader Haniyeh in Tehran,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 22:13:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ewr870z23o," Israel's defence minister has for the first time acknowledged that Israel killed Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.Israel Katz made the comments in a speech vowing to target the heads of the Iran-backed Houthi movement in Yemen, which has been firing missiles and drones at Israel.Haniyeh was killed in a building where he was staying in the Iranian capital in an attack widely attributed to Israel.Separately, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said some progress had been made towards agreeing a ceasefire in Gaza with Hamas, but he could not give a timeline for when a deal would be reached. It comes after a senior Palestinian official told the BBC that talks between Hamas and Israel were 90% complete, but key issues remained.In his speech, Katz said Israel would ""strike hard"" at the Houthis and ""decapitate"" its leadership.""Just as we did with Haniyeh, [Yahya] Sinwar, and [Hassan] Nasrallah in Tehran, Gaza, and Lebanon, we will do so in Hodeida and Sanaa,"" he said, referring to Hezbollah and Hamas leaders who have all been killed this year.Haniyeh, 62, was widely considered Hamas's overall leader and played a key role in negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.After his assassination, Hamas named Yahya Sinwar, its leader in Gaza and one of the chief architects of the 7 October attacks, as the group's overall leader. Sinwar was killed by the Israeli military in a chance encounter in Gaza in October and the group is still in the process of choosing a new leader.Hassan Nasrallah meanwhile was the leader of the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah - he was assassinated in Beirut in September as Israel dramatically escalated its military campaign against Hezbollah, with which it had been trading near daily cross-border fire since the day after the 7 October attacks.The Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group that controls north-western Yemen, began attacking Israeli and international ships in the Red Sea shortly after Israel began targeting Hamas in Gaza last October. The group has vowed to continue until the war in Gaza ends.On Saturday, Israel's military said its attempts to shoot down a projectile launched from Yemen were unsuccessful and the missile struck a park in Tel Aviv. A Houthi spokesman said the group hit a military target using a hypersonic ballistic missile.Last week Israel launched strikes against what it said were Houthi military targets, hitting ports as well as energy infrastructure in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. The US and UK have also attacked Houthi targets as part of an operation to protect international shipping.Hamas attacked Israel in October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 people hostage.In response, Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in Gaza which has continued for more than a year and has killed 45,317 people according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the Strip.That figure includes 58 people killed by Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours, Hamas officials said. Local medical officials said that at least 11 people were killed in three separate strikes on the al-Mawasi area, which had been designated a ""safe zone"" by the Israeli military. Israel said it was targeting a Hamas fighter.On Monday Israel said three of its soldiers had been killed in the northern Gaza Strip. Humanitarian and rights groups have warned of a catastrophic situation for civilians in Gaza. On Sunday Oxfam said just 12 trucks had distributed food and water in northern Gaza over the past two-and-a-half months and blamed the Israeli military for ""deliberate delays and systematic obstructions"".""For three of these, once the food and water had been delivered to the school where people were sheltering, it was then cleared and shelled within hours,"" Oxfam added.The Israeli authorities said the report was ""deliberately and inaccurately"" ignoring the ""extensive humanitarian efforts made by Israel in the northern Gaza Strip"". Israel insisted that specific shipments ""including food, water, and medical supplies"" had been sent to northern areas of Gaza, including Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia and Jabalia, where the Israeli military has for several months been carrying out a military operation that it says is targeting Hamas fighters who had regrouped there.The Oxfam report comes after rights groups Amnesty accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza and Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Israel of committing ""acts of genocide"" by deliberately depriving Palestinian civilians in Gaza of adequate access to water.Israel's foreign ministry described the Amnesty report as ""entirely false and based on lies"" while the Israeli foreign ministry's spokesman said Human Rights Watch  was ""once more spreading its blood libels... The truth is the complete opposite of HRW's lies""."
On patrol with Kenyan forces inside Haiti's gang warzone,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 00:19:19 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xj5xqq9w8o," Two-year-old Shaina is hooked up to an intravenous drip at one of the few functioning hospitals in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. Her mother, Venda, desperately hopes it will alleviate the acute malnutrition the emaciated young girl is suffering from.Shaina is one of 760,000 children who are on the brink of famine in Haiti.Terrified of the gang warfare raging in her neighbourhood, for weeks Venda was too frightened to leave her home to seek treatment for her daughter.Now that she has made it to the paediatric ward, she hopes it is not too late for Shaina. ""I want to get proper care for my child, I don't want to lose her,"" she says tearfully.Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse, and now an estimated 85% of the capital is under gang control.Even inside the hospital, Haitians are not safe from the fighting, which the UN says has killed 5,000 people this year alone and left the country on the verge of collapse.The hospital's medical director explains that the previous day, police clashed with gang members in the emergency ward among terrified patients.The victims of the violence are everywhere. One ward is full of young men with gunshot wounds.Pierre is one of them. He says he was walking home from work when he was caught in the crossfire of one street battle, with a bullet ripping through his collar bone.""I think if the government were more stable and had put in place better youth programmes, they would not get involved in the gangs,"" he says of the young men who make up a large proportion of the groups terrorising the capital.To combat the growing violence, the UN Security Council authorised the establishment of a Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) in October 2023.Funded primarily by the US, the Kenyan-led force deployed to Haiti six months ago tasked with restoring law and order.On a patrol in downtown Port-au-Prince, the ferocity of the gang violence is clear.Kenyan officers drive along the streets in heavily armoured personnel carriers (APC) through once bustling areas of the capital that now lie deserted. Shops and houses are boarded up.Burnt out cars and debris are piled high along the side streets - barricades built by the gangs to block access. The convoy weaves its way through the rubble when suddenly it comes under fire.Bullets slam into the APC's armour as the Kenyan police shoot back with their assault rifles through gun ports in the vehicle's walls.After nearly an hour of back-and-forth gunfire, the convoy moves on. But it is not long before there are signs of more horrific gang violence. A human body burns in the middle of the street. One of the Kenyan police in our APC says he suspects it was a gang member cornered and killed by a rival group, his body set alight to send a gruesome warning.The Kenyan officers on our patrol are by now well accustomed to seeing this sort of brutality on the streets of Port-au-Prince, but they also tell us they are exhausted.Four hundred officers arrived in June - but they are hugely outnumbered. In July, Haiti's government estimated there were 12,000 armed gang members in the country.The Kenyans were promised additional personnel. When the UN authorised the mission, a force of 2,500 was envisioned, but that support, which was supposed to arrive in November, has yet to materialise.Despite the situation, the force's leadership remains optimistic. Commander Godfrey Otunge is under pressure from the Kenyan government to make a success of this mission. The mission commander says there is ""overwhelming support"" for the MSS in Haiti.""The population are demanding that our team extend and go to other places and pacify,"" he says.The uphill struggle they face is clear at a former Haitian police station, which had been occupied by a gang but has now been re-taken by the Kenyan forces.It is still entirely surrounded by gangs and, as officers head up to the roof, they come under sniper fire.The Kenyan officers shoot back while urging everyone to remain low. The Kenyan officers say some of their much-delayed additional forces will arrive by the end of this year, bringing their total to 1,000.And the support is urgently needed. There are areas in Port-au-Prince which are under such tight gang control they are virtually impenetrable for the police.In one such area, Wharf Jérémie, almost 200 civilians were killed by a single gang over the space of one weekend earlier in December.In total, as many as 100 gangs are estimated to be operating in the Port-au-Prince area, with boys as young as nine joining their ranks.And the problem only appears to be growing. According to the UN children's agency, Unicef, the number of children recruited to the gangs has soared by 70% in a year.One of the gang leaders to whom they flock is Ti Lapli, whose real name is Renel Destina.As head of the Gran Ravine gang, he commands more than 1,000 men from his fortified headquarters high above Port-au-Prince.Gangs like his have exacerbated an already dire situation in Haiti, and are known to slaughter, rape and terrorise civilians.Gran Ravine is infamous for carrying out kidnappings for ransom, a practice which has earned Ti Lapli a place on the FBI's wanted list. Ti Lapli tells us that he and his gang members ""love our country a lot"" - but when pressed on the rapes and murders gangs like his inflict on civilians, he claimed his men ""do things they weren't supposed to do [to members of rival gangs] because the same is done to us"".The reason children join Gran Ravine is simple, he says: ""The government doesn't create any jobs, it's a country with no economic activity whatsoever. We are living on trash, it's basically a failed state.""He failed to acknowledge the strangulating impact gangs like his have on Haiti's economy. Often afraid to leave their homes for work, civilians are regularly extorted for money, too.With 700,000 residents forced to flee their homes due to the violence inflicted by groups such as Gran Ravine, the capital's schools have become camps for internally displaced people.Negociant is one of those who has had to seek shelter. She sits with her five children, squeezed onto the small section of a school balcony they now call home.""Just weeks ago I was living in my own house,"" she says. ""But gangs took over my neighbourhood.""She explains that she left for an area of the city called Solino, until that too was overrun by gangs and she fled along with hundreds of other people.""Today, again, I'm on the run to save my life and my children,"" she says."

Dog rehomed after three years due to BBC coverage,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 06:17:11 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4x15nwqk3o," A rescue dog who spent 1,000 days and the last three Christmases in kennels will celebrate this year with its new owners. Sarah, a three-year-old lurcher, was chosen by her new family when they read a plea for help by the RSPCA Block Fen Centre in Cambridgeshire on the BBC website.The dog has moved in with the Baker family in Nottinghamshire and new owner Joanne said ""since coming home with us she has relaxed and become a loved member of our family"".Sarah was taken in during November 2021, but only became available for rehoming in December 2022 due to court proceedings as part of a large welfare case. Ms Baker said: ""After reading her story on the BBC News website, I couldn't stand to think a young dog could potentially spend the rest of her life in kennels.""We live in an old farmhouse in a small village; Sarah enjoys the garden and, with our other lurcher Charlie, loves zoomies out there. ""I can't say it's doing a lot of good for our grass, but they are having a great time and that is what counts.""She said house training for Sarah only took a week.It will be Sarah's first Christmas in a home and the family were keen to make it extra special, giving the dogs a stocking filled with treats, a long walk and a bit of Christmas dinner. Tiffany Saunders, RSPCA kennel supervisor at Block Fen in Wimblington, said: ""Sarah had previously twice come so close to finding a family of her own - but now she is living the best life. ""If any dog deserves a family of their own it's Sarah. ""Before she came to us, her life had been awful as she was shut in a kennel all the time and didn't know how to walk on a lead and had to be carried out of the venue she was rescued from.""

Australian towns evacuated over Christmas as fires rage,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 03:08:17 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20ezgv89edo," Residents in an Australian region engulfed by bushfires were given two hours to return home to collect their belongings before Christmas on Tuesday, as emergency crews try to contain the blaze. Communities around the Grampians, in Victoria, have been evacuated amid warnings from authorities that conditions there in the days ahead could be the worst since Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called ""Black Summer"" of 2019-20. The bushfires have already burnt over 41,000 hectares (101,000 acres) of land in the past week, however there have been no deaths or loss of property. Intense heat forecast for Boxing Day has also prompted a string of fire warnings across the country.  Throughout Victoria, temperatures are expected to reach 40C (104F) and be accompanied by strong dry winds, while parts of South Australia and New South Wales could also face bushfire conditions on Thursday into Friday.""We're expecting to see extreme fire danger across almost the entire state,"" Luke Hegarty, a spokesman for Victoria's State Control Centre, said. ""This is the most significant fire danger that the state has seen – across the whole sections of state that we're talking about – since Black Summer. It's important that people understand that Thursday is a day with serious potential,"" he added. Four interstate firefighting forces and two incident management teams - made up of over 100 personnel - will land in Victoria in the coming days to provide reprieve for emergency crews that have been working around the clock to fight the current fires. The decision to give families around the Grampians temporary access to their homes ""to get Christmas items … presents and the like"" on Tuesday morning was made by the state's Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer, Jason Heffernan. ""[This is] to ensure if the residents of Halls Gap will be relocated for Christmas, at least they will have what they need,"" he told Seven's Sunrise programme. Mary Ann Brown, who lives on the southern edge of the Grampians National Park, told the ABC that her community are on edge heading into the holidays. ""We are not out of the woods until we get a really good drop of rain and that may not come until March or April, so it's going to be a long summer.""Parts of Australia have been on high alert for bushfire danger this summer, following several quieter seasons compared with the 2019-20 fires which were linked to hundreds of deaths and swept across 24 million hectares of land.The country has reeled from disaster to disaster in recent years, experiencing both record breaking floods and extreme heat, as it feels the effects of climate change."
Luigi Mangione pleads not guilty to murdering healthcare CEO,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 17:42:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwypvd9kdewo," The suspect accused of killing UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson has pleaded not guilty to murder and terrorism charges in New York state.Luigi Mangione, 26, appeared in court on Monday to be arraigned on 11 state criminal counts, including murder as an act of terrorism. As well as the state-level charges, he is also accused of federal (national-level) stalking and murder offences that could lead to a death penalty sentence.Prosecutors allege that Mr Mangione shot Mr Thompson in central Manhattan before going on the run. Authorities later arrested him at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania.  Mr Mangione appeared in court on Monday wearing a maroon sweater, white-collared shirt and khaki trousers. In addition to a long stream of journalists waiting for the suspect to appear, members of the public - almost all of them young women - were in court, some of whom told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that they were there to show their support.Mr Mangione is facing 11 state criminal counts in New York, including first-degree murder and murder as a crime of terrorism.If convicted of all the counts, he would face a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.Federal prosecutors have also separately charged Mr Mangione for using a firearm to commit murder and interstate stalking resulting in death. Both charges could make him eligible for the death penalty. He has yet to enter a plea on those charges.Prosecutors have said the federal and state cases will move forward parallel with one another.In court last week, Mr Mangione's lawyer - Karen Friedman Agnifilo - said that the two sets of charges appear to conflict, with the state charges accusing him of seeking to ""intimidate or coerce a civilian population"" while the federal charges focus on crimes against an individual.Ms Agnifilo said that the overlapping cases were ""confusing"" and ""highly unusual"".""I've never seen anything like what is happening here"" in 30 years of practising law, she said.In court on Monday, she further told the judge that she believed that statements from government officials - including New York City Mayor Eric Adams - make her ""very concerned about my client's right to a fair trial"". ""This is a young man,"" she said. ""He is being treated like a human ping-pong ball between two warring jurisdictions here.""She also accused state and federal authorities of treating Mr Mangione like ""political fodder"" and a ""spectacle"" by bringing him back to New York by helicopter, surrounded by officials and armed guards, in full view of cameras and journalists. The judge, Gregory Carro, said that he is unable to control what happens outside court, but vowed that Mr Mangione would receive a fair trial. In response, the state's prosecutor said that he had never seen a case with a ""higher volume"" of quality evidence.  The suspect is currently in federal custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) Brooklyn after being returned to New York amid heavy security last week.Authorities believe that Mr Mangione carried out a targeted killing of Mr Thompson, pointing to evidence that he was angry at the US healthcare industry.The federal complaint notes that a notebook found in Mr Mangione's possession expressed ""hostility towards the health insurance industry and wealthy executives in particular.""Some on social media praised Mr Mangione's alleged crimes, often sharing their own anger at the US private healthcare system.Speaking to CBS, the BBC's US partner, on Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said that the online rhetoric has been ""extraordinarily alarming"".""It speaks of what is really bubbling here in this country,"" he said. ""And unfortunately we see that manifested in violence, the domestic violent extremism that exists."""

"Scientists unveil 50,000-year-old baby mammoth remains","Mon, 23 Dec 2024 18:26:04 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy47xj4lpyzo," Russian scientists have unveiled the remains of a 50,000-year-old baby mammoth found in thawing permafrost in the remote Yakutia region of Siberia during the summer.They say ""Yana"" - who has been named after the river basin where she was discovered - is the world's best-preserved mammoth carcass.Weighing in at over 100kg (15st 10lb), and measuring 120cm (4ft) tall and 200cm long, Yana is estimated to have been only about one year old when she died.Before this, there were only six similar discoveries in the world - five in Russia and one in Canada. Yana was found in the Batagaika crater, the world's largest permafrost (ground that is permanently frozen) crater, by people living nearby.The residents ""were in the right place at the right time"", the head of the Lazarev Mammoth Museum Laboratory said.""They saw that the mammoth had almost completely thawed out"" and decided to build a make-shift stretcher to lift the mammoth to the surface, said Maxim Cherpasov.""As a rule, the part that thaws out first, especially the trunk, is often eaten by modern predators or birds,"" he told the Reuters news agency.But ""even though the forelimbs have already been eaten, the head is remarkably well preserved"", he added.A researcher at the museum, Gavril Novgorodov, told Reuters the mammoth ""probably got trapped"" in a swamp, and was ""thus preserved for several tens of thousands of years"".Yana is being studied at the North-Eastern Federal University in the region's capital Yakutsk.Scientists are now conducting tests to confirm when it died.It is not the only pre-historic discovery to have been found in Russia's vast permafrost in recent years - as long-frozen ground starts to thaw because of climate change.Just last month, scientists in the same region showed off the remains of a partial, mummified body of a sabre-tooth cat, thought to be just under 32,000 years old.And earlier this year the remains of a 44,000-year-old wolf were also uncovered."
Greenland again tells Trump it is not for sale,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 17:18:11 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c791xy4pllqo," Greenland has once again said it is not for sale after US President-elect Donald Trump said he wanted to take control of the territory.""Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland,"" its prime minister said on Monday, a day after Trump repeated comments about the Arctic island that he first made several years ago.Greenland, which is an autonomous Danish territory, is home to a large US space facility and lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe, meaning it is strategically important for the US.  There was no immediate response to Trump's comments from Denmark. Writing on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Sunday, the US president-elect said: ""For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.""His comments prompted a sharp rebuke from Greenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede, who said: ""We are not for sale and we will not be for sale.""""We must not lose our long struggle for freedom. However, we must continue to be open to co-operation and trade with the whole world, especially with our neighbours,"" he said. Trump's controversial remarks came hours after he announced that he intended to nominate Ken Howery, his former ambassador to Sweden, to be the new ambassador to Denmark. Mr Howery said he was ""deeply humbled"" by the nomination and looked forward to working with the staff at the US embassy in Copenhagen and the US consulate in Greenland to ""deepen the bonds between our countries"". Trump's original suggestion in 2019 that the US acquire Greenland, which is the world's largest island, led to a similarly sharp rebuke from leaders there.The then Danish Prime Minister Mette Fredericksen, who still holds the role, described the idea as ""absurd"", leading Trump to cancel a state trip to the country.He is not the first US president to suggest buying Greenland. The idea was first mooted during the 1860s under the presidency of Andrew Johnson.Separately on Sunday, Donald Trump threatened to reassert control over the Panama Canal, one of the world's most important waterways - accusing Panama of charging excessive fees for access to it.Panama's president later said ""every square metre"" of the canal and surrounding area belonged to his country."

Biden commutes most federal death sentences,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 00:31:52 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkxe4xlvgxo," US President Joe Biden has commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates, switching their penalty to life in prison without parole.The three excluded from the measure include the Boston Marathon bomber and the  man who killed Jewish worshippers in 2018.In a statement, Biden said he was ""more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level"". His measure does not include more than 2,000 people convicted to death by state authorities.Biden's decision comes before the return of President-elect Donald Trump in January, who resumed federal executions when he was in office. Biden issues 39 presidential pardons and commutes 1,500 sentences Among those reprieved by Biden are nine people convicted of murdering fellow prisoners, four for murders committed during bank robberies and one who killed a prison guard.""Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,"" Biden added. Disgraced former New Orleans police officer Len Davis, who operated a drug ring involving other officers and arranged a woman's murder, is among those who have been shown clemency. Billie Allen, who had been on federal death row for 27 years, said he felt ""great relief"" after Biden commuted his sentence.Allen was convicted of murdering a security guard during a bank robbery in Missouri in 1997. He has always maintained his innocence.Speaking to the BBC's Radio 4 World Tonight programme from Terra Haute prison in Indiana, Allen said inmates were ""excited they were no longer facing death"" when they learnt of the decision.""You have to realise that when you are facing death every day, to have that burden off you, it's a great relief.""Asked about the anger of some victims' families at the decision, Allen said: ""I understand that for some people the death penalty is justice... but these guys in here some said that they were going to use this opportunity to do better, to be better - so maybe they can take some solace in that.""Heather Turner, whose mother Donna Major was shot dead in a bank robbery in South Carolina in 2017, said she was ""hurt"" and ""very frustrated"" that the killer had his death sentence commuted.Turner told BBC's World Tonight: ""I feel that this decision comes without regard to the victims and their families.""To make this decision, especially at Christmas, it is gut-wrenching.""""Justice is not only doing right. It is also handing out the right consequences. And I believe the consequence for murder is death,"" Turner said, adding she thought Biden's decision was ""politically motivated"".The three inmates remaining on death row include Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who helped carry out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, and avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof who shot and killed nine Black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015.Robert Bowers, who killed 11 Jewish worshippers during a mass shooting in 2018 at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, will also remain on death row.Four other men remain on military death row, which operates under a separate jurisdiction.Biden has campaigned as an opponent of the death penalty, and the Justice Department issued a moratorium on its use at federal level after he became president.During his first term in office, Trump oversaw 13 deaths by lethal injection during his final six months in power.There had been no federal inmates put to death in the US since 2003 until Trump resumed federal executions in July 2020.During his re-election campaign, Trump indicated he would expand the use of capital punishment to include human and drug traffickers, as well as migrants who kill American citizens. Biden appeared to make reference to Trump's intentions in his statement by saying he could not ""in good conscience - stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted"".In US law, these clemency decisions cannot be reversed by a president's successor.The president's announcement was criticised by some Republicans. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said on X, formerly Twitter, that Democrats ""are the party of politically convenient justice"" after the news of the commutations became public.""Once again, Democrats side with depraved criminals over their victims, public order, and common decency,"" he said.Biden's decision will not impact people sentenced to death in state courts, which is around around 2,250 inmates according to the Death Penalty Information Centre. More than 70 state executions have been carried out during Biden's presidency.The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states. Six other states, including Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee, have moratoriums in place.Earlier this month, Biden commuted the sentences of nearly 1,500 people and pardoned 39 more convicted of non-violent crimes.He also pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases. He had pleaded guilty to tax charges earlier in September, and was found guilty of being an illegal drug user in possession of a gun in June - becoming the first child of a sitting president to be a convicted of a crime.The US Constitution decrees that a president has the broad ""power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment""."
Gavin & Stacey: An exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the Christmas finale,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 01:53:22 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrwjnn1dpqo," ""It can't carry on after this,"" explains James Corden. ""It just can't.""Standing outside his mobile dressing room in a car park on the outskirts of Cardiff, the co-creator of Gavin & Stacey is explaining why the sitcom is ending after 17 years.""Look, obviously there's lots we can't talk about. But Christmas Day will be the last time that we ever see all these characters get together.""He insists that it is ""not up for debate"" and the show, which he also co-writes and stars in as Smithy, will not be, to use the show's distinctive parlance, occurring again.""There are some things happening in this special which really, really tell us that has to be it. We can't see a way how it could go on. So that's the reason to end it now.""From 21:00 on Christmas Day around the country, this much-loved show will be wrapped up amongst the wrapping paper. It is just after 8am on a grey October morning. BBC News has been invited to spend a day watching one of the final ever filming days of Gavin & Stacey for a half-hour iPlayer special.Our first stop is the make-up truck, where Ruth Jones, Nessa in the show, is having a Welsh dragon tattoo applied to her arm.""The girls are always in before the boys,"" she laughs.""James Corden is in for five or six minutes at most. I'm in for an hour and a quarter. But the results speak for themselves,"" she chortles, ""And he misses out on the really, really dirty, disgusting gossip.""One mirror along, Joanna Page is being turned into Stacey, although hearing her chat to the crew, she is pretty much Stacey to start with.Her subjects for that morning's session include Christmas decorations, a change in the weather (""a great topic"") and ear piercings (""at the end of filming I'm going to get another to mark that the whole thing is done""). James Corden arrives to use the beard clippers and perhaps inadvertently gives away one of the more telling little nuggets of detail about the show, when he explains his stubble must stay that length: ""Because it's only set over four days.""Rob Brydon, already wearing Uncle Bryn's finest brown party clothes, is ruthlessly teased when he arrives. The cast are heading out for a team curry that evening and it has been decided that he should pay, having managed to host a corporate event and squeeze in a voiceover gig around yesterday's filming.He pulls a that-won't-be-happening face, before saying his major concern is when the dinner will finish, due to the early starts on set. Soon he has the whole room laughing with his impression of Ronnie Corbett having his make-up done.They are clearly a cast who love spending time with one another, even this early in the morning.Jones has headed back to her trailer. When I walk past five minutes later, she is standing in the doorway holding a plate, which she tilts towards me: ""See we do eat omelettes on this show,"" she laughs, ""Although this one was not made by Gwen."" After a short minibus ride to the commuter village of Dinas Powys, the cast arrive at a very familiar detached house, in totally the wrong part of the country.For 17 years, this is where scenes at Pam and Mick's have been filmed, with the Vale of Glamorgan, doubling up for Essex.Tents have been erected on the outside of the garage, to provide room for all the equipment and monitors. We watch as a party scene involving limbo dancing, is filmed from every angle, as Bryn downs shots and Nessa gives Smithy a lesson in how to eat the Greek yogurt dish, tzatziki. (""Don't use the cracker. Use the bread."")What is not clear, is how this follows on from the proposal cliff-hanger at the end of 2019 Christmas special, which was watched by 18.5 million people, more than a quarter of the UK population.""Well, I can tell you is it isn't set at Christmas,"" shares James Corden, who explains having already set one Christmas Day special in Barry and one in Essex, it was felt that concept had been done.""I can tell you it's set after that moment. There's no time jump, we're not going back in time,"" he adds. Perched between monitors and directors' chairs, Jones explains one major change: ""It's 90 minutes. And all of the characters have got their own little story in there, which is lovely. Because if you are fond of a show, you love all the characters.""It's a bit like, I used to love the Wombles when I was little and I would love any story about any of the Wombles.""However, Corden refutes the idea that the length now means it is a film. ""I don't want to say it's a film because I think that brings expectations of scale and that I'm not sure our show could ever reach.""Sitting on a sofa that has survived from the first series, actress Alison Steadman is loving being back in Pam's domain, but says she is ""really, really dreading"" the final day of filming.""It's been such fun over the last 17 years,"" she says. ""People love it and stop me all the time to talk about it. I love Pam. She's so crackers.""She too is confident that all is going to end well, describing the finale as having ""storylines that'll go in a direction that people aren't anticipating.""At this point the house's actual musical doorbell rings out, and we both laugh at the very Pam-ness of it all. Her onscreen husband Larry Lamb has spent much of the scene that is being filmed, standing behind Mick's bar pouring shots, while wearing shorts.He believes the show's continued popularity is to do with the way: ""Everybody in it represents an element of the life of contemporary Britain.""Everybody's in there. And if they're not, somebody they know, and love is in there in that form.""For Mathew Horne, having played Gavin for 17 years is throwing up all sorts of existential questions: ""I'm putting to one side all my neuroses about that and to the ageing process.""""It's incredible because it is part of people's upbringing, you know. And we were all in their homes as they were growing up, and now they're adults and out in the world, and it's extraordinary how much the show means to people. So yeah, it's a lifetime for me, but it's a lifetime for so many other people."" At the end of the street, a crowd of about 50 fans have gathered to watch the last week of filming, including Lisa Lacking who has travelled down from Cheshire.Through the fan community she has become friends with Brenda Kenyon, who owns the house which is used on screen as Stacey's family home. And during this she is sleeping in the room used for Stacey's bedroom.Her hopes for the last episode are simple: ""There's got to be wedding.""Rob Brydon is adamant that fans will be satisfied: ""It's a lovely ending to the show. There are definitely surprises. Things that we as the cast went, 'What!'""He also reveals that he cried whilst reading the script to his wife: ""She thinks the ending is terrific."" Back inside, the cast are becoming nostalgic. Corden points out the exact spot in the kitchen where Smithy made his curry order, before gesturing towards the stairs where Pam and Mick once appeared in matching kimonos, revealing that one crucial piece of the show will take place there.With the 2019 Christmas special having been set in Wales, Joanna Page has not been in Pam and Mick's for 15 years, so is bamboozled by the lay out of the house (""I don't remember this mezzanine walkway"") but is making the most of every day.""Knowing that this finally is the last one, sort of makes you savour everything just all the more.""These moments that we get together are so special because they're not going to happen again, in these circumstances, in these costumes, all of us together.""Of all the cast, she has made off with the most souvenirs, ranging from, ""an ornamental cat type thing that might be a fish"" from Stacey's house to almost the whole of the outfit she's wearing (""these boots are pretty fab, this is a haul""). Jones is hugging a cup of tea, waiting to be called for a scene where she will be dancing to Abba, and thinking about how close they are to the end, but how pleased they all are that it is on their terms.""This is a full stop,"" she says ruefully.""I think we are very lucky to get to choose to end it, rather than to be told, 'Sorry, we don't want anymore.' I think it's lovely to be able to say a very healthy farewell to it.Before we go, I ask James Corden, how he would like the show to be remembered.He takes his time to really think about this and then talks at length about what he believes to be the show's DNA, including ""all the stuff that makes life good, which is friends, family and love"".The conclusion to his thesis is: ""I hope it's remembered as a show that can make people feel good, that can bring comfort and a sense of warmth and history. That would be lovely if people spoke about it like that.""Now he is waiting to see how the finale is received.""If  we can land the plane safely and just give it over to everybody else on Christmas Day, I don't know, what a trip man, what an absolute trip it's all been.""Gavin & Stacey: The Making of the Finale, a 26-minute documentary, is available on the iPlayer now. The finale itself is broadcast at 21:00 GMT on Christmas Day on BBC One."

BBC apologises after abortion trial collapse,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 14:34:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yd9j8j62go," The trial of a woman accused of illegally aborting her baby collapsed due to ""appalling and sloppy"" reporting by the BBC, a judge has said. Sophie Harvey, 25, and her boyfriend Elliot Benham, 25, accepted they had purchased abortion pills online, but she denied taking them.The couple stood trial at Gloucester Crown Court in May, but the jury was discharged after an application by their lawyers who cited inaccurate reports of the proceedings by BBC Points West.The BBC apologised to the court for the ""unintentional"" errors. The court heard the opening headlines of the Points West episode on 16 May had shown archive footage of a property in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, with a tent and scenes of crime officers working, and stated: ""The remains were found in the garden.""Later in the report of that day's trial proceedings, a TV reporter said that Harvey had taken the pill.She had insisted she gave birth to a stillborn child in the bathroom of her home in Cirencester in 2018 and had not taken an abortion pill. Tom Godfrey, representing Harvey, applied for the jury to be discharged due to the reporting, saying it would go to the issue of his client's credibility as she maintained she did not take the abortion pill.Judge Ian Lawrie KC said it was ""appalling and sloppy"" reporting from the BBC, before dismissing the jury.A BBC spokeswoman said: ""The BBC apologised to the court for the unintentional errors in some of our reporting of the trial in May 2024.""Our apology was accepted by the judge hearing the case.""A new trial had been fixed for February 2025, but Harvey and Benham pleaded guilty to a new offence of conspiracy to procure a poison with intent to procure a miscarriage.

""Burt passed away peacefully over the weekend, estimated to be over 90 years old, marking the end of an incredible era."" In the film, character Mick Dundee (Hogan) swaps the Australian outback for the jungle of New York after meeting American reporter Sue Charlton (Kozlowski), who eventually falls in love with him.The croc is famously seen in the scene where Kozlowski's character is attacked as she kneels next to a creek.Burt, who was captured in the 1980s in the Northern Territory's Reynolds River, was described by Crocasourus Cove as having a ""bold"" personality.""Burt was a confirmed bachelor - an attitude he made clear during his earlier years at a crocodile farm,"" the centre's statement continued.""His fiery temperament earned him the respect of his caretakers and visitors alike, as he embodied the raw and untamed spirit of the saltwater crocodile.""""Burt was truly one of a kind. He wasn't just a crocodile; he was a force of nature and a reminder of the power and majesty of these incredible creatures.  ""While his personality could be challenging, it was also what made him so memorable and beloved by those who worked with him and the thousands who visited him over the years. The statement concluded: ""Visitors from around the globe marvelled at his impressive size and commanding presence, especially at feeding time.""It's not unusual for saltwater crocodiles to live beyond 70 years old, especially in captivity. Burt will be honoured with a commemorative sign at the attraction. Crocodile Dundee remains the highest grossing Australian film of all time, taking $47,707,598 (Australian dollars).It also spawned two sequels, 1988's Crocodile Dundee II and 2001's Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.Hogan and Kozlowski got married in 1990 but later divorced.A documentary on the making of the film is expected to be released next year."
'I cook my Christmas dinner in five air fryers',"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 02:44:05 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx3n7lgllo," A cookery writer has decided to ditch the traditional oven and cook her entire Christmas dinner using air fryers.Self-confessed ""air fryer bore"" Beverley Jarvis, from Ashford in Kent, will use five of the appliances to feed 11 of her loved ones a festive feast.Ms Jarvis said making the switch had already saved her time and money.""Air fryers are a no-brainer,"" she told BBC Radio Kent.  ""I work with air fryers all the time. I've got one in the utility room and four in the kitchen,"" she added. The appliances have become more popular during the cost-of-living crisis as they cost half the price of cooking in an oven, the BBC's Sliced Bread programme found.They work by blowing very hot air, at high speed, all around the food. ""Every day I normally use two, and I just think they're fantastic,"" said Ms Jarvis. ""So you're saving on electricity, and they're so quick to heat up - just three minutes to reach 200C."" Ms Jarvis shared her recipe for an oven-free Christmas dinner. ""Try a turkey breast roll - you can either ask the butcher to do it or buy one in the supermarket,"" she said.She said an average-sized turkey breast roll that would feed six would take 55 minutes at 180C.""The bigger air fryers will take a bigger bird.""But what about the much-loved roasties? ""The brilliant thing is that you can add the potatoes towards the end and give them 35 minutes,"" she said.""Just turn it up to 190C; you'll get wonderful crispy potatoes with your turkey roll.""And for side dishes and snacks? ""You can do pigs in blankets; they will take about 10 minutes at 190C,"" she said.""Sausage rolls are a cinch - 15 minutes at 200C will produce delicious, crispy sausage rolls.""They're better than perfect."" Ms Jarvis said she has experimented with cooking other meats in her air fryers.""Gammon is fantastic. I cooked the whole thing in the air fryer, quite a big piece of gammon for 10 people, and it was absolutely delicious,"" she said.""At the end, I glaze it with maple syrup, marmalade and, in my recipe, a bit of whiskey.""Ms Jarvis said she wrapped the meat in foil and placed onions and carrots below.She also recommended an alternative festive snack, which included grating half a block of parmesan, adding a quarter of teaspoon of chopped chillies, a few pumpkin seeds and herbs.""You literally take the base plate out of the air fryer, heat it to 200C, very lightly oil the base, then put soup spoons of your cheese in blobs around the base,"" she said.""They take four minutes at 190C, and they go lacey and crispy, and they are delicious with a glass of bubbly.""

Guatemala police clash with Jewish sect over 160 at-risk children,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 10:57:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnv3291z9p2o," Authorities in Guatemala have resisted efforts by members of a Jewish sect to recapture 160 children rescued from its premises.The children were taken into care on Friday when police raided a farm used by the Lev Tahor movement, which is under investigation in several countries for serious sexual offences.Interior Minister Francisco Jimenez said they were allegedly being abused by a member of the sect.But on Sunday, sect members broke into a care centre where they were being held in an attempt to get them back, leading to scuffles with police. The Lev Tahor sect is known for extremist practices and imposing a strict regime on its followers.It advocates child marriage, inflicts harsh punishments even for minor transgressions and requires women and girls as young as three years old to completely cover up with robes.The sect accuses the Guatemalan authorities of religious persecution.The community settled in Mexico and Guatemala between 2014 and 2017. In 2022, members of the sect were arrested in a police operation in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, but they were later freed for lack of evidence. The events began when police raided the sect's farm in Oratorio, south-east of Guatemala City, on Friday, taking the children into care.Prosecutors said there were suspicions of ""forced pregnancy, mistreatment of minors and rape"".But two days later, about 100 of the children's relatives - all members of the sect - gathered outside the centre where they were being held to call for their return.Some sect members then forced open the gate and tried to abduct the children and adolescents sheltered there, the Attorney General's Office said.But the children were intercepted by the authorities and put into a white minibus, local media reported.With police help, the centre ""managed to locate and protect everyone again"", the Attorney General's Office added.Officials had previously tried to check on the children's wellbeing, but were prevented from entering the farm by sect members.Authorities estimate that the community is made up of about 50 families residing in Guatemala, the US, Canada and other countries.The Jewish Community of Guatemala has issued a statement disowning the sect, describing it as foreign to its own organisation.It expressed support for the Guatemalan authorities in carrying out necessary investigations ""to protect the lives and integrity of minors and other vulnerable groups that may be at risk""."

Kremlin denies reports Assad's wife has filed for divorce,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 14:22:10 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8n6lk97r2o," The British-born wife of deposed Syrian president Bashar al-Assad is not seeking a divorce, a Kremlin spokesman has said.Reports in Turkish media had suggested Asma al-Assad wanted to end her marriage and leave Russia, where she and her husband were granted asylum after a rebel coalition overthrew the former president's regime and took control of Damascus.Asked about the reports in a news conference call, Dmitry Peskov said, ""No, they do not correspond to reality.""He also denied reports that Assad had been confined to Moscow and that his property assets had been frozen. Russia was a staunch ally of the Assad regime and offered it military support during the civil war.But reports in Turkish media on Sunday suggested the Assads were living under severe restrictions in the Russian capital, and that the former Syrian first lady had filed for divorce and wanted to return to London.Mrs Assad is a dual Syrian-British national, but the UK foreign secretary has previously said she would not be allowed to return to Britain. Speaking in parliament earlier this month, David Lammy said: ""I want it confirmed that she's a sanctioned individual and is not welcome here in the UK.""He added he would do ""everything I can in my power"" to ensure no member of the Assad family ""finds a place in the UK"". In a statement attributed to Bashar al-Assad last week, he said he had never intended to flee Syria, but he was airlifted from a Russian military base at Moscow's request. Asma al-Assad, 49, was born in the UK to Syrian parents in 1975 and grew up in Acton, west London.She moved to Syria in 2000 at the age of 25 and married her husband just months after he succeeded his father as president.Throughout her 24 years as Syria's first lady, Mrs Assad was a subject of curiosity in western media.A controversial 2011 Vogue profile called her ""a rose in the desert"" and described her as ""the freshest and most magnetic of first ladies"". The article has since been removed from the Vogue website.Just one month later, Mrs Assad was criticised for remaining silent while her husband violently repressed pro-democracy campaigners at the start of the Syrian civil war. The conflict went on to claim the lives of around half a million people, with her husband accused of using chemical weapons against civilians.  In 2016, Mrs Assad told Russian state-backed television she had rejected a deal to offer her safe passage out of the war-torn nation in order to stand by her husband.She announced she was being treated for breast cancer in 2018 and said she had made a full recovery one year later. She was diagnosed with leukaemia and began treatment for the disease in May this year, the office of then-President Assad announced. A statement said she would ""temporarily withdraw"" from public engagements. "
Detained Ugandan politician's wife condemns ban on Christmas Day visit ,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 00:13:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99xml5dkp7o," The wife of detained Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye has denounced as ""cruel and inhumane"" a ban on prisoners receiving visitors on Christmas Day. Besigye, 68, has been charged in a military court with possession of pistols and attempting to purchase weapons abroad, which he denies. His trial has been delayed until next month.Prison authorities say that as part of measures to prevent ""potential security lapses"", inmates would not be allowed visitors  for seven days, starting on Christmas Eve. Besigye's wife Winnie Byanyima, the head of the UN's organisation to tackle HIV and Aids, said she planned to camp outside the Luzira Prison so that she could see her husband and give him food on Christmas Day.   She told the BBC her husband remains ""strong and persevering"" in a ""tiny little room"" behind six prison gates, but she was worried that he could be ""harmed"". ""I'm not leaving Besigye's food at the gate [as directed]. I will go there and see my husband because I don't trust them with him even for a single day,"" Ms Byanyima said. ""Maybe I will take a tent and sleep there… if that's what they want,"" she added.Besigye has contested and lost four presidential elections against President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986.But the veteran opposition politician has been less active in politics in recent years, and did not contest the 2021 election.Besigye, however, returned to the headlines last month after he was dramatically abducted while visiting Kenya and forcibly taken to Uganda. He was then charged along with an aide, Obeid Lutale. He, too, has denied the charges. How a Ugandan opposition leader disappeared in KenyaWho is Kizza Besigye?The military court extended Besigye's detention until 7 January, dashing the hopes of his family that he will be home for Christmas.Uganda Prisons Services spokesperson Frank Baine Mayanja told local media that  the seven-day ban on visitors was intended to tighten security during the festive season, and to prevent escapes.""Christmas causes excitement and majority of prisoners do not want to have Christmas inside. They must be planning on how to do a prison break and go outside,"" Mr Mayanja told NTV Uganda.The Prison Services had initially announced a ban of almost a month on prison visits, but then reduced the ban to seven days. Ms Byanyima told the BBC she was also concerned about the recent change of leadership at Luzira prison, questioning why a ""young and inexperienced"" official had been put in charge of it.""It is very suspicious and makes me doubt their intentions,"" she said.""I do not trust his [Besigye's] life with those who abducted him. I will seek to see him as often as I can,"" Ms Byanyima added. Mr Mayanja said the changes in leadership were an ""administrative issue"" and had nothing to do with Besigye. He added that Ms Byanyima should trust the authorities to take care of her husband because ""we have the means and mechanism of keeping him alive"". ""I think she should let us do our job,"" Mr Mayanja said. This is the second time Besigye, who has had run-ins with Museveni's government  for the last two decades, is spending the Christmas holidays in prison.In 2005, he was arrested while returning from a political rally ahead of the 2006 presidential polls and charged with treason. The charges were thrown out by the courts. He was also charged with rape in a separate case. The charges were later dropped. He said all the allegations were part of a campaign of political persecutionIn the latest case, Besigye has objected to being tried by a military court, saying he should be tried in a civilian court if there was any case against him.Museveni has defended the use of military courts to try civilians. He said any crime involving a gun was dealt with in a military court to ensure the country's stability as civilian courts took too long to deal with cases.Hundreds of civilians have been tried in Uganda's military courts, even though the Constitutional Court has ruled against the practice.Opposition parties have frequently complained about restrictions on political activities, alleging that Museveni fears political competition. Museveni's supporters deny the allegation, and say he has maintained stability during his rule of almost 40 years.

King's Christmas message to come from former hospital chapel,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 12:16:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd60xej41wjo," This year's Christmas message from King Charles will be delivered from a former hospital chapel, in a year in which the King has been undergoing cancer treatment.The location for the traditional Christmas Day broadcast is the Fitzrovia Chapel in central London, which once served as the chapel of the Middlesex Hospital.It's the first time in more than a decade that the Christmas speech has been recorded from a place that isn't in a royal palace or estate - and it's understood that the King wanted a location with a connection to those working in healthcare.The ornately-decorated 19th Century former chapel building is now used for exhibitions and community events for people of any faiths and none. As well as a connection to the health services, the building also ties in with the King's interest in building bridges between different beliefs, backgrounds and religions.The location suggests that healthcare and supporting community links could be themes for the annual speech, after a summer in which relations in some towns had been frayed by riots.The traditional speech from the monarch, recorded earlier this month, will be broadcast as usual on television and radio at 15:00 on Christmas Day.The Christmas message comes at the end of a year in which the King faced a cancer diagnosis.His regular sessions of treatment are continuing, as they have for much of this year, but as a sign of a positive response, he has plans for a busy schedule of engagements and overseas trips in 2025.Setting the speech in this former hospital chapel, which was renovated and reopened in 2016, will be a reminder of the efforts of those working in the health services and medical research.The King has been filmed beside a Christmas tree, which has since been donated to a hospice in Clapham. The small chapel, decorated in the Gothic Revival style with shimmering mosaics and Byzantine influences, is tucked away in Pearson Square, in a quiet corner of London's West End.It was built in the courtyard of what was the Middlesex Hospital, serving its staff and patients. When the hospital was demolished the chapel was retained and restored, with a new development built around it.It's no longer regularly used for services, but is used for community events and concerts and is open to visitors wanting some quiet contemplation.The monarch's Christmas message has often been recorded in Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle.But there have been exceptions, most recently in 2010 when it was filmed at Hampton Court Palace, and before that in 2006 at Southwark Cathedral. In 2003 the speech was recorded at an army barracks in Windsor.The run-up to Christmas has seen the King attending a series of seasonal events, including a Christmas market in Battersea, a service remembering those persecuted because of their religion and an event in Walthamstow celebrating the diversity of the local community.The King's speech on Christmas Day follows a tradition dating back to 1932, when George V made the first Christmas broadcast.That first speech was scripted by Rudyard Kipling, who lay in state in the Fitzrovia Chapel before his funeral in Westminster Abbey."
Ex-Israeli agents reveal how pager attacks were carried out,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 13:13:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy3l02wxqdo," Two former Israeli intelligence agents have revealed how members of the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah used Israeli made walkie-talkies booby-trapped with explosives for 10 years before they were detonated in a surprise attack in September this year.The two ex-Mossad agents told CBS News how Hezbollah was duped into buying thousands of rigged walkie-talkies and pagers without realising they were made in Israel.Dozens of people were killed and thousands injured in the attacks. Israel said it was tailored to target only Hezbollah members, but civilians were among the victims, Lebanese officials said.The UN human rights chief called the attack a war crime.  At the time of the attack, Israel and Hezbollah were fighting a conflict which had spiralled since Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions a day after Hamas's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.On 17 September this year, thousands of pagers simultaneously exploded across Lebanon, mainly in areas with a strong Hezbollah presence. The blasts wounded or killed users and some people nearby, spreading panic and confusion. The following day walkie-talkies exploded in the same way, killing and injuring hundreds more.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted that Israel was responsible two months later, Israeli media reported at the time.In an interview with CBS, the BBC's US media partner, the two former agents divulged details of the operation.One of the agents, given the name Michael, said Mossad had concealed an explosive device inside the batteries operating the walkie-talkies, which he said would typically be carried in a vest nearer the wearer's heart. He said Hezbollah had unwittingly bought over 16,000 walkie-talkies at ""a good price"" from a fake company 10 years ago.""We have an incredible array of possibilities of creating foreign companies that have no way of being traced back to Israel,"" Michael said. ""Shell companies over shell companies to affect the supply chain to our favour. ""We create a pretend world. We are a global production company. We write the screenplay, we're the directors, we're the producers, we're the main actors, and the world is our stage.""The operation expanded two years ago to include pagers, CBS said.Mossad said it found that at the time Hezbollah was buying pagers from a Taiwanese company called Gold Apollo. It set up a fake company which used the Gold Apollo name on pagers rigged with explosives, without the parent company realising.CBS said Mossad put explosives inside that were powerful enough to hurt only the user. ""We test everything triple, double, multiple times in order to make sure there is minimum damage,"" said the second agent, whom the programme called Gabriel. It said Mossad specifically chose a ringtone which would sound urgent enough for someone to check an incoming message.Gabriel said the agency duped Hezbollah into buying the pagers, making advertising films and brochures, and sharing them on the internet.""When they are buying from us, they have zero clue that they are buying from the Mossad,"" he said. ""We make like [movie] Truman Show, everything is controlled by us behind the scene.""Hezbollah had bought 5,000 of the booby-trapped pagers by September 2024, CBS reported.They were triggered from Israel when Mossad feared Hezbollah began to have suspicions, it said.The explosions caused shockwaves across Lebanon, with detonations happening everywhere the pagers were being carried, including in supermarkets. Hospitals were overwhelmed with casualties, many of whom had been maimed.Gabriel said there was a ""strong rumour"" that people also fell victim in front of the Hezbollah leader at the time, Hassan Nasrallah.Days later, with Hezbollah still reeling from the attack, Israel began intense waves of air strikes against Hezbollah targets, followed by a ground invasion of Lebanon.The two sides agreed to a ceasefire on 26 November.Lebanon strongly condemned the pager and walkie-talkie attacks, while the UN's human rights chief, Volker Turk, said they had left him ""appalled"".The method of attacks, he said, ""violates international human rights law and, as applicable, international humanitarian law""."

Indian fans fed up with paying top prices for stinking toilets and traffic jams at concerts,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 22:13:42 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy480kly9zo," When Amrita Kaur decided to attend Punjabi pop star Diljit Dosanjh's concert in India this month, she was prepared to experience some discomfort.Having attended several concerts in the past, Ms Kaur was sort of looking forward to the ""exhilarating chaos"" that comes with large crowds at big events in India.But what awaited her was far worse than she had imagined.Crowd control was minimal and sanitation non-existent. Overloaded mobile networks stopped working, sparking fears about personal safety. Even using the toilet felt like a gamble, she said, as it meant having to spend the rest of the performance queued up in front of ""unhygienic, smelly cubicles"".The venue, a massive piece of government-owned land in the northern city of Chandigarh, had no public transport connections or parking space, leaving Ms Kaur with no option but to drive her car to a friend's nearby - and then get stuck in the inevitable, hours-long traffic jam once the concert had ended.""You pay so much for a ticket and what do you get in return? A possible urinary infection and a bad headache with some bouts of music,"" she says about her experience.This year has been big for India's burgeoning concert industry, with major tours by Dua Lipa, Dosanjh and Maroon 5 packing stadiums and grounds already thrilling audiences. Other international acts like Green Day, Coldplay and Ed Sheeran are set to perform in the coming months.In fact, India's music concerts generated about 8bn rupees ($94.1m; £75.3m) in revenue last year - a figure that is set to increase by 25% by the end of 2025.Young, well-to-do Indians are not just willing to pay more to see their favourite music stars, but are actively seeking out these events. In 2023, more than 400,000 people in India said they travelled to other Indian cities to attend live events.But despite the enthusiasm, many concertgoers say their experience has been far from ideal. The issue made headlines earlier this week, when a diabetic patient with incontinence issues said he ended up soiling himself at a Bryan Adams concert due to unavailability of washrooms at the venue.On the same day, Dosanjh, who has been on a nationwide tour, shocked his fans by announcing that he wouldn't perform in India again until the infrastructure at concert venues got better. The singer later clarified he was referring to only one of the venues. Since then, social media has been awash with similar complaints from concertgoers. From booking tickets on dodgy scalping websites for astonishingly high prices, to braving hours-long traffic before and after a show, often on a full bladder, fans say they have to pay with more than just money to see their favourite acts.Those who have the means are now opting to attend shows in other countries for a safer and generally more fun experience. ""At Adele's concert in Munich, the staff continuously cleaned the toilets and it was super clean even after a three-hour concert,"" says Ishika Goon, a Bengaluru-based lawyer. ""If I have to spend so much money, I might as well go for the full experience.""Organisers and promoters acknowledge the problems but say they too are hobbled by wider infrastructural challenges.That's because India does not have enough venues dedicated to live concerts, forcing them to opt for suboptimal spaces or simply avoid certain cities altogether, all of which prevents the industry from scaling up, says Anmol Kukreja, the co-founder of Skillbox, a live entertainment company that has organised more than 300 concerts.Unlike a lot of western countries where concert venues are plenty, he says that events in India have to be held in places like malls, sports stadiums or on public land - all of which come with their own limitations and many variables.A mall might have better toilets and designated parking areas, but it won't necessarily be able to accommodate huge crowds the way a large barren ground located in a far-flung corner of the city with bad connectivity might.Nowadays, a lot of music events are held inside public stadiums to minimise some of the inconveniences - but that comes with its own challenges, such as poor sound quality, crowd management issues and lots of red tape. Government-owned venues are more suitable for big events, but the process of booking them can often be a complex ""web of permissions and licences, making them less attractive"", Mr Kukreja says.To address these gaps, organisers end up spending thousands of dollars on building temporary infrastructure at venues - the stage, temporary bathrooms and parking spaces - before each concert which could incur serious losses, adds Tej Brar, founder of Mumbai-based Third Culture and the director of NH7, one of India's biggest music festivals.And it's not just business that suffers, the live music scene is impacted too, as a whole segment of smaller and independent artists are left out because they are not ""big enough"" to make people want to pay an exorbitant price to watch them.""If they can't pull crowds of more than 10,000 people or more, they usually won't get shows because the economics won't work for the organisers.""But of late, even major international music festivals with star-studded line-ups and million-dollar budgets have left fans disappointed.""Everything is fine but why can't you have clean toilets?"" asks Sreoshi Mukherjee, a Delhi-based journalist.Ms Mukherjee, who attends music concerts around the country, was particularly aghast by the lack of washrooms at Lollapalooza and Backstreet Boys, tickets for which cost anywhere between 5,000 ($59; £47) and 10,000 ($118; £94) rupees.""There was a point when the loos ran out of both toilet paper and water. We had to actually buy water bottles to relieve ourselves,"" she says. Criticism against inflated ticket prices turning these events into highbrow cultural experiences meant for only a few has been mounting, but there are other accessibility concerns as well.Most venues have little to no arrangements for people with disabilities - such as wheelchair access and audio description. At Dosanjh's Chandigarh concert, Ms Kaur said they had to carry their wheelchair-using friend into the venue as there was no ramp or accessibility lane.The BBC has reached out to the organisers of all the events mentioned in the story for comment.Others in the business say there can't be a one-size-fits all solution for the problems, but they worry about its longer impact on business. Right now, people are still willing to pay. But persistently poor facilities might change their minds.""Word-of-mouth plays a crucial role in event attendance, and negative feedback can be damaging to an organiser's reputation,"" Mr Brar says.But the onus to fix that, he adds, needs to be shared. ""While the company takes charge of choosing the location and setting ticket prices, the venue should provide fundamental amenities. Adequate washroom facilities and dedicated cleaning staff should be a venue standard.""As the country gears up to host big names like Sheeran and Green Day, fans are hoping for a better experience. And for some, huge crowds and the risk of a potential infection still feels like a small price for seeing their favourite star.""There's a thrill to the mess and chaos,"" says Mohammad Sami, a student.""It's like you're stuck on an island with hundreds of strangers, united by their determination to survive the night."""
Cadbury loses royal warrant after 170 years,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 12:22:30 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lg9y791kyo," Chocolate maker Cadbury has been dropped from the list of royal warrants for the first time in 170 years.The Birmingham-based chocolatier was awarded its first royal warrant as chocolate and cocoa manufacturers by Queen Victoria in 1854, but it has lost its royal endorsement under King Charles.Cadbury's US owners, Mondelez International, said it was disappointed to have been stripped of its warrant.The King has granted royal warrants to 386 companies that previously held warrants from Queen Elizabeth II, including John Lewis, Heinz and Nestle. Companies holding the Royal Warrant of Appointment, granted for up to five years, are recognised for providing goods or services to the monarchy.Among the King's new list of warrant holders are many firms selling food and drink, such as Moet and Chandon, Weetabix and chocolate makers Bendicks and Prestat Ltd.Warrant holders are allowed to use the coat of arms of the royal they are associated with on packaging, as part of advertising or on stationery.Earlier this year, the King was urged by campaign group B4Ukraine to withdraw warrants from companies ""still operating in Russia"" after the invasion of Ukraine, naming Mondelez and consumer goods firm Unilever, which has also been stripped of the endorsement.""Whilst we are disappointed to be one of hundreds of other businesses and brands in the UK to not have a new warrant awarded, we are proud to have previously held one, and we fully respect the decision."" a Mondelez spokesperson said.Unilever added it was ""very proud"" of the long history its brands had supplying the royal household, most recently receiving a warrant from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Prof David Bailey, from Birmingham Business School, said the decision to strip the chocolate manufacturer of its warrant would affect its costs, as the brand would have to remove it from all packaging.A royal warrant was a ""kind of seal of approval,"" which was thought to bring significant benefits to the UK economy, he added.Speaking to BBC Radio WM, Prof Bailey said British companies also benefited from being awarded the royal endorsement.""What is a royal warrant for, if it isn't to help British jobs and British production?"" he asked. The British chocolate giant celebrated its 200th anniversary earlier this year, after founder John Cadbury opened a grocer's shop selling cocoa and drinking chocolate in Birmingham on 4 March 1824.The brand expanded when his sons took over the business, eventually building the Bournville factory which became the biggest cocoa manufacturer in the world.US food company Kraft took over the brand in a controversial takeover in 2010, with Cadbury going on to become part of its Mondelez division in 2012.

Hollywood stars support Blake Lively over legal complaint,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 10:09:31 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dqy828dl3o," Hollywood stars America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel have publicly backed US actress Blake Lively after she filed a legal complaint against It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni.Ms Lively filed the legal complaint over the weekend against Mr Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment and a campaign to ""destroy"" her reputation.Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC on Saturday that the allegations are ""categorically false"".Ferrera, Tamblyn and Bledel, who starred with Lively in 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, issued a joint statement on Instagram on Sunday saying they ""stand with her in solidarity"". Colleen Hoover, the author of It Ends With Us, also showed her support, describing Ms Lively as ""honest, kind, supportive and patient"".Lawyers for Ms Lively say the legal complaint follows a meeting earlier this year to address ""repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour"" by Baldoni, her co-star and a producer on the movie.In their statement, Ferrera, Tamblyn and Bledel said:  ""As Blake's friends and sisters for over 20 years, we stand with her in solidarity as she fights back against the reported campaign waged to destroy her reputation.""Throughout the filming of It Ends with Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set, and we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice."" They added: ""Most upsetting is the unabashed exploitation of domestic violence survivors' stories to silence a woman who asked for safety. The hypocrisy is astounding.""We are struck by the reality that even if a woman is as strong, celebrated, and resourced as our friend Blake, she can face forceful retaliation for daring to ask for a safe working environment,"" the statement added.""We are inspired by our sister's courage to stand up for herself and others."" Lawyers for Mr Baldoni said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met. In the drama It Ends With Us, Ms Lively plays a woman who finds herself in a relationship with a charming but abusive boyfriend, played by Mr Baldoni.In a post to her Instagram stories, Colleen Hoover, the author of the novel on which the film was based, also voiced her support: ""@BlakeLively you have been nothing but honest, kind, supportive and patient since the day we met.""Thank you for being exactly the human that you are.""Never change. Never wilt.""She then linked to a New York Times article titled We Can Bury Anyone: Inside A Hollywood Smear Machine.Hoover also re-posted the statement from Ferrara, Bledel and Tamblyn, adding: ""This statement from these women and Blake's ability to refuse to sit down and 'be buried' has been nothing short of inspiring.""The meeting between Ms Lively and Mr Baldoni, together with others involved in the movie's production plus Ms Lively's actor husband Ryan Reynolds, took place on 4 January 2024, and it aimed to address ""the hostile work environment"" on set, according to Ms Lively's legal filing.Mr Baldoni attended the meeting in his capacity as co-chairman and co-founder of the company that produced the film, Wayfarer Studios. He was also the film's director.In the legal complaint, Ms Lively's lawyers allege that both Mr Baldoni and the Wayfarer chief executive officer, Jamey Heath, engaged in ""inappropriate and unwelcome behaviour towards Ms Lively and others on the set of It Ends With Us"".In the filing to the California Civil Rights Department, a list of 30 demands relating to the pair's alleged misconduct was made at the meeting to ensure they could continue to produce the film.Among them, Ms Lively requested that there be no more mention of Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath's previous ""pornography addiction"" to Ms Lively or to other crew members, no more descriptions of their own genitalia to Ms Lively, and ""no more adding of sex scenes, oral sex, or on camera climaxing by BL [Blake Lively] outside the scope of the script BL approved when signing onto the project"", says the complaint.Ms Lively also demanded that Mr Baldoni stop saying he could speak to her dead father. Ms Lively's legal team further accuse Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios of leading a ""multi-tiered plan"" to wreck her reputation.She alleges this was ""the intended result of a carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others from speaking out about the hostile environment that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath created"".Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: ""It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.""Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including ""threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film"", which would end up ""ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met"".He alleged that Ms Lively's claims were ""intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media"".In a statement via her attorneys to the BBC, Ms Lively said: ""I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.""She also denied that she or any of her representatives had planted or spread negative information about Mr Baldoni or Wayfarer.The film was a box-office hit, although some critics said it romanticised domestic violence."

Honda and Nissan join forces to take on China in cars,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 16:24:48 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy3ljvv93lo," Honda and Nissan plan to merge as the two Japanese firms seek to fight back against competition from the Chinese car industry.Joining forces would create one of the world's biggest car producers alongside Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors and Ford.The potentially multibillion dollar deal to combat ""the rise of Chinese power"" was a key driver behind the plan, said Honda's chief executive Toshihiro Mibe.Mr Mibe said a plan to ""fight back"" needs to be in place by 2030, or they risk being ""beaten"" by rivals. The merger, which would include Mitsubishi - of which Nissan is the biggest shareholder -  would allow all three companies to share resources against other electric vehicle competitors such as Tesla. The growing electric car market has been increasingly dominated by Chinese-made electric vehicles, including BYD, which have posed a threat to some of the world's best known car firms.""There is a rise of Chinese power and emerging forces and the structure of the automobile industry is changing,"" Mr Mibe told reporters at a press conference announcing the merger talks.Growing competition in China has left many car makers struggling to compete, as lower labour and manufacturing costs make local firms more nimble and able to price their goods lower than foreign counterparts, making them far more attractive to buyers.It has led to China becoming the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles.In October, EU officials said the Chinese state was unfairly subsidising its EV makers and announced big taxes on imports of EVs from China to the EU, after the majority of member states backed the plans. The tariffs are set to rise from 10% to 45% for the next five years, but there are concerns it could raise EV prices higher for buyers. The total sales of Nissan and Honda is more than $191bn (£152bn), said Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida.In March, the two Japanese car makers agreed to explore a strategic partnership for electric vehicles (EVs).""The talks started because we believe that we must build up capabilities to fight them, including the current emerging forces, by 2030. Otherwise we will be beaten"", said Mr Mibe.He added that the deal was not a bailout of Nissan, which has been struggling with falling sales.In November, Nissan said it will cut around 9,000 jobs as it slashes global production to tackle a drop in sales in China and the US. The cuts mean its global production will be reduced by a fifth.Nissan, once a symbol of Japan's car making strength, has spent the past few years trying to regain its footing after the arrest of longtime chief executive Carlos Ghosn. Mr Ghosn faced charges of financial misconduct when he fled Japan in 2019, and is currently the subject of an Interpol Red Notice, which is a request to law enforcement worldwide to find and arrest a person. Mr Ghosn, currently in Lebanon, told reporters in December that Nissan's merger plans were an act of panic and desperation.Mr Mibe said that any merger would be dependent on the turnaround of Nissan.Honda and Nissan agreed in March to cooperate in their EV businesses, and in August deepened their ties, agreeing to work together on batteries and other technology.However, any deal is likely to come under intense political scrutiny in Japan as it may result in job cuts, whilst Nissan is likely to unwind its alliance with French auto firm Renault."

Trump threatens to try to regain control of Panama Canal,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 14:47:31 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98l9wj67jgo," President-elect Donald Trump has demanded Panama reduce fees on the Panama Canal or return it to US control, accusing the central American country of charging ""exorbitant prices"" to American shipping and naval vessels.""The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, highly unfair,"" he told a crowd of supporters in Arizona on Sunday.""This complete rip-off of our country will immediately stop,"" he said, referring to when he takes office next month.His remarks prompted a quick rebuke from Panama's president, who said ""every square metre"" of the canal and surrounding area belong to his country. President José Raúl Mulino added that Panama's sovereignty and independence were non-negotiable.Trump made the comments to supporters of Turning Point USA, a conservative activist group that provided significant support to his 2024 election campaign.It was a rare example of a US leader saying he could push a country to hand over territory - although he did not explain how he would do so - and a sign of how American foreign policy and diplomacy may shift once he enters the White House following his inauguration on 20 January.Trump's comments followed a similar post a day earlier in which he said the Panama Canal was a ""vital national asset"" for the US.If shipping rates are not lowered, Trump said on Sunday, ""we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, quickly and without question"".Can the Panama Canal save itself?Will Trump's victory spark a global trade war?Listen: More or Less: Did 35,000 Americans die building the canal?The 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal cuts across the central American nation and is the main link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.Up to 14,000 ships travel through it each year, including container ships carrying cars, natural gas and other goods, and military vessels.It was built in the early 1900s. The US maintained control over the canal zone until 1977, when treaties gradually ceded the land back to Panama. After a period of joint control, Panama took sole control in 1999.The US reserved the right to use military force in defence of the canal against any threat to its neutrality - a threat which now appears to be coming from the US itself.The neutrality treaty guarantees fair access for all nations and non-discriminatory tolls. Different shipping companies do pay different amounts for passing through the canal - but this depends on the size of the ship and the load on board, not on the country of origin.Canal transit costs have increased over the past year due to a historic drought, according to analysis by leading shipping industry website Lloyd's List.Some 75% of the cargo passing through the waterway in the latest fiscal year was either destined for or originated from the US, according to the Panama Canal Authority.However, the users of the canal are ship operators and owners, not countries themselves. As well as Panama, the president-elect also took aim at Canada and Mexico over what he called unfair trade practices. He accused them of allowing drugs and immigrants into the US, although he called Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum a ""wonderful woman"".Trump made his remarks in front of thousands at Turning Point's annual conference, one of the country's largest gatherings of conservative activists.Turning Point poured huge resources into get-out-the-vote efforts in swing states designed to bolster Trump and other Republicans during the election campaign.It was his first speech since a deal passed Congress this week to keep the US government open, after several provisions were removed including one that would have increased the country's debt ceiling.Trump had supported raising the debt ceiling, which restricts the amount of money the US government can borrow.But his speech on Sunday avoided that issue entirely, instead recapping his election victory and hitting on themes – including immigration, crime and foreign trade – that were mainstays of his campaign.He did, however, mention Elon Musk. ""You know, they're on a new kick,"" he said. ""All the different hoaxes. The new one is that President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon Musk.""""No, no, that's not happening,"" he said. ""He's not gonna be president.""Several speakers here at the conference were critical of government spending and of politicians in both parties – however the divisions inside the Republican Party which have played out in Congress in recent days were mostly muted."
"A dam ignited rare Tibetan protests. They ended in beatings and arrests, BBC finds","Mon, 23 Dec 2024 08:59:54 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d37zg1549o," Hundreds of Tibetans protesting against a Chinese dam were rounded up in a harsh crackdown earlier this year, with some beaten and seriously injured, the BBC has learnt from sources and verified footage.Such protests are extremely rare in Tibet, which China has tightly controlled since it annexed the region in the 1950s. That they still happened highlights China's controversial push to build dams in what has long been a sensitive area.Claims of the arrests and beatings began trickling out shortly after the events in February. In the following days authorities further tightened restrictions, making it difficult for anyone to verify the story, especially journalists who cannot freely travel to Tibet. But the BBC has spent months tracking down Tibetan sources whose family and friends were detained and beaten. BBC Verify has also examined satellite imagery and verified leaked videos which show mass protests and monks begging the authorities for mercy.The sources live outside of China and are not associated with activist groups. But they did not wish to be named for safety reasons. In response to our queries, the Chinese embassy in the UK did not confirm nor deny the protests or the ensuing crackdown. But it said: ""China is a country governed by the rule of law, and strictly safeguards citizens' rights to lawfully express their concerns and provide opinions or suggestions."" The protests, followed by the crackdown, took place in a territory home to Tibetans in Sichuan province. For years, Chinese authorities have been planning to build the massive Gangtuo dam and hydropower plant, also known as Kamtok in Tibetan, in the valley straddling the Dege (Derge) and Jiangda (Jomda) counties.Once built, the dam's reservoir would submerge an area that is culturally and religiously significant to Tibetans, and home to several villages and ancient monasteries containing sacred relics. One of them, the 700-year-old Wangdui (Wontoe) Monastery, has particular historical value as its walls feature rare Buddhist murals.The Gangtuo dam would also displace thousands of Tibetans. The BBC has seen what appears to be a public tender document for the relocation of 4,287 residents to make way for the dam. The BBC contacted an official listed on the tender document as well as Huadian, the state-owned enterprise reportedly building the dam. Neither have responded.Plans to build the dam were first approved in 2012, according to a United Nations special rapporteurs letter to the Chinese government. The letter, which is from July 2024, raised concerns about the dam's ""irreversible impact"" on thousands of people and the environment.From the start, residents were not ""consulted in a meaningful way"" about the dam, according to the letter. For instance, they were given information that was inadequate and not in the Tibetan language. They were also promised by the government that the project would only go ahead if 80% of them agreed to it, but ""there is no evidence this consent was ever given,"" the letter goes on to say, adding that residents tried to raise concerns about the dam several times. Chinese authorities, however, denied this in their response to the UN. ""The relocation of the villages in question was carried out only after full consultation of the opinions of the local residents,"" the Permanent Mission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations office said in a letter from September 2024.  It added: ""Local government and project developers funded the construction of new homes and provided subsidies for grazing, herding and farming. As for any cultural relics, they were relocated in their entirety.""But the BBC understands from two Tibetan sources that, in February, officials had told them they would be evicted imminently, while giving them little information about resettlement options and compensation. This triggered such deep anxiety that villagers and Buddhist monks decided to stage protests, despite knowing the risks of a crackdown. The largest one saw hundreds gathering outside a government building in Dege. In a video clip obtained and verified by the BBC, protesters can be heard calling on authorities to stop the evictions and let them stay. Separately, a group of residents approached visiting officials and pleaded with them to cancel plans to build the dam. The BBC has obtained footage which appears to show this incident, and verified it took place in the village of Xiba. The clip shows red-robed monks and villagers kneeling on a dusty road and showing a thumbs-up, a traditional Tibetan way of begging for mercy. In the past the Chinese government has been quick to stamp out resistance to authority, especially in Tibetan territory where it is sensitive to anything that could potentially feed separatist sentiment. It was no different this time. Authorities swiftly launched their crackdown, arresting hundreds of people at protests while also raiding homes across the valley, according to one of our sources. One unverified but widely shared clip appears to show Chinese policemen shoving a group of monks on a road, in what is thought to be an arrest operation.Many were detained for weeks and some were beaten badly, according to our Tibetan sources whose family and friends were targeted in the crackdown.One source shared fresh details of the interrogations. He told the BBC that a childhood friend was detained and interrogated over several days.""He was asked questions and treated nicely at first. They asked him 'who asked you to participate, who is behind this'.""Then, when he couldn't give them [the] answers they wanted, he was beaten by six or seven different security personnel over several days.""His friend sustained only minor injuries, and was freed within a few days. But others were not so lucky.Another source told the BBC that more than 20 of his relatives and friends were detained for participating in the protests, including an elderly person who was more than 70 years old.""Some of them sustained injuries all over their body, including in their ribs and kidneys, from being kicked and beaten… some of them were sick because of their injuries,"" he said.Similar claims of physical abuse and beatings during the arrests have surfaced in overseas Tibetan media reports. The UN letter also notes reports of detentions and use of force on hundreds of protesters, stating they were ""severely beaten by the Chinese police, resulting in injuries that required hospitalisation"".  After the crackdown, Tibetans in the area encountered even tighter restrictions, the BBC understands. Communication with the outside world was further limited and there was increased surveillance. Those who are still contactable have been unwilling to talk as they fear another crackdown, according to sources.The first source said while some released protesters were eventually allowed to travel elsewhere in Tibetan territory, others have been slapped with orders restricting their movement. This has caused problems for those who need to go to hospital for medical treatment and nomadic tribespeople who need to roam across pastures with their herds, he said.The second source said he last heard from his relatives and friends at the end of February: ""When I got through, they said not to call any more as they would get arrested. They were very scared, they would hang up on me.""We used to talk over WeChat, but now that is not possible. I'm totally blocked from contacting all of them,"" he said. ""The last person I spoke to was a younger female cousin. She said, 'It's very dangerous, a lot of us have been arrested, there's a lot of trouble, they have hit a lot of us'… They didn't know what was going to happen to them next.""The BBC has been unable to find any mention of the protests and crackdown in Chinese state media. But shortly after the protests, a Chinese Communist Party official visited the area to ""explain the necessity"" of building the dam and called for ""stability maintenance measures"", according to one report.A few months later, a tender was awarded for the construction of a Dege ""public security post"", according to documents posted online.The letter from Chinese authorities to the UN suggests villagers have already been relocated and relics moved, but it is unclear how far the project has progressed. The BBC has been monitoring the valley via satellite imagery for months. For now, there is no sign of the dam's construction nor demolition of the villages and monasteries.The Chinese embassy told us authorities were still conducting geological surveys and specialised studies to build the dam. They added the local government is ""actively and thoroughly understanding the demands and aspirations"" of residents. China is no stranger to controversy when it comes to dams.When the government constructed the world's biggest dam in the 90s - the Three Gorges on the Yangtze River - it saw protests and criticism over its handling of relocation and compensation for thousands of villagers.In more recent years, as China has accelerated its pivot from coal to clean energy sources, such moves have become especially sensitive in Tibetan territories.Beijing has been eyeing the steep valleys and mighty rivers here, in the rural west, to build mega-dams and hydropower stations that can sustain China's electricity-hungry eastern metropolises. President Xi Jinping has personally pushed for this, a policy called ""xidiandongsong"", or ""sending western electricity eastwards"".   Like Gangtuo, many of these dams are on the Jinsha (Dri Chu) river, which runs through Tibetan territories. It forms the upper reaches of the Yangtze river and is part of what China calls the world's largest clean energy corridor.Gangtuo is in fact the latest in a series of 13 dams planned for this valley, five of which are already in operation or under construction.The Chinese government and state media have presented these dams as a win-win solution that cuts pollution and generates clean energy, while uplifting rural Tibetans.In its statement to the BBC, the Chinese embassy said clean energy projects focus on ""promoting high-quality economic development"" and ""enhancing the sense of gain and happiness among people of all ethnic groups"".But the Chinese government has long been accused of violating Tibetans' rights. Activists say the dams are the latest example of Beijing's exploitation of Tibetans and their land.""What we are seeing is the accelerated destruction of Tibetan religious, cultural and linguistic heritage,"" said Tenzin Choekyi, a researcher with rights group Tibet Watch. ""This is the 'high-quality development' and 'ecological civilisation' that the Chinese government is implementing in Tibet.""One key issue is China's relocation policy that evicts Tibetans from their homes to make way for development - it is what drove the protests by villagers and monks living near the Gangtuo dam. More than 930,000 rural Tibetans are estimated to have been relocated since 2000, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW).Beijing has always maintained that these relocations happen only with the consent of Tibetans, and that they are given housing, compensation and new job opportunities. State media often portrays it as an improvement in their living conditions. But rights groups paint a different picture, with reports detailing evidence of coercion, complaints of inadequate compensation, cramped living conditions, and lack of jobs. They also point out that relocation severs the deep, centuries-old connection that rural Tibetans share with their land.""These people will essentially lose everything they own, their livelihoods and community heritage,"" said Maya Wang, interim China director at HRW.There are also environmental concerns over the flooding of Tibetan valleys renowned for their biodiversity, and the possible dangers of building dams in a region rife with earthquake fault lines.Some Chinese academics have found the pressure from accumulated water in dam reservoirs could potentially increase the risk of quakes, including in the Jinsha river. This could cause catastrophic flooding and destruction, as seen in 2018, when rain-induced landslides occurred at a village situated between two dam construction sites on Jinsha.The Chinese embassy told us that the implementation of any clean energy project ""will go through scientific planning and rigorous demonstration, and will be subject to relevant supervision"".In recent years, China has passed laws safeguarding the environment surrounding the Yangtze River and the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. President Xi has personally stressed the need to protect the Yangtze's upper reaches. About 424 million yuan (£45.5m, $60m) has been spent on environmental conservation along Jinsha, according to state media. Reports have also highlighted efforts to quake-proof dam projects.Multiple Tibetan rights groups, however, argue that any large-scale development in Tibetan territory, including dams such as Gangtuo, should be halted. They have staged protests overseas and called for an international moratorium, arguing that companies participating in such projects would be ""allowing the Chinese government to profit from the occupation and oppression of Tibetans"".""I really hope that this [dam-building] stops,"" one of our sources said. ""Our ancestors were here, our temples are here. We have been here for generations. It is very painful to move. What kind of life would we have if we leave?""Additional reporting by Richard Irvine-Brown of BBC VerifyUPDATE: This story has been updated to include China's response to the UN about the Gangtuo dam in a letter dated 12 September 2024.

The TV highlights to look out for over Christmas,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 12:47:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewxjqn5vpeo," The out-of-office is on, the mulled wine is mulling, and the highlighter pen is out as families look ahead to the best of this year's Christmas TV.

EastEnders will air at 19:45, followed by a Christmas edition of The Repair Shop hosted by Roman Kemp (20:15), before the season finale of Strike: The Ink Black Heart at (21:15).Those looking forward to Gavin & Stacey on Christmas Day may wish to prepare by rewatching the 2019 special, which BBC One repeats tonight at 22:35. There's an embarrassment of riches for quiz show fans over on BBC Two, with special editions of Richard Osman's House of Games (19:15), Celebrity Mastermind (19:45), Only Connect (20:15) and University Challenge (20:45).On ITV, Coronation Street fans will be treated to a special episode at 20:45 as Audrey tries to stop Gail from leaving the cobbles - a storyline which is leading up to the previously announced exit of actress Helen Worth. ITV also has an episode of Emmerdale (19:00), a countdown of the Top 100 TikTok Videos of 2024 (21:15), and Royal Carols: Together at Christmas (19:30), hosted by the Princess of Wales. And there will be a sweet treat on Channel 4 the same evening as fans tuck into The Great Christmas Bake Off (20:00) ahead of a best-of-year compilation on Gogglebox (21:15).Other highlights include Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing (21:15, BBC Two) and Christmas at the Four Seasons: Park Lane (20:15, Channel 5).

Meanwhile on ITV, those who enjoyed Home Alone on Christmas Eve can watch the sequel on Christmas Day, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (15:10).After that, look out for specials of Emmerdale (18:30), Coronation Street (19:00) and The Chase (20:00), before 2022 film Downton Abbey: A New Era (21:00). But the highlight of their schedule this year is arguably the return of Bullseye (17:25), a reboot of the 1980s and 1990s gameshow, hosted by Freddie Flintoff alongside 17-year-old darts prodigy Luke Littler.Channel 4 are keeping their film offering traditional with Miracle on 34th Street (17:00), before Claudia Winkleman, Mika and Lang Lang return for a special edition of The Piano at Christmas, filmed at Battersea Power Station (19:05).The Railway Children Return (15:10) will be on Channel 5, before the network dedicates its evening programming to the UK's favourite Comedy Moments (17:15), Christmas Party Songs (19:15) and 1980s Songs (21:15). Everybody likes a film on 26 December as their stomach recovers, and BBC One have plenty, including Inside Out (09:55), Paddington (13:50), 2017's Beauty and the Beast (15:15) and Matilda (17:40).Other movie highlights include Gladiator (21:00, BBC Two), Grease (15:00, ITV), The Queen (20:00, ITV3) and Crocodile Dundee (16:40, Channel 4).Films aside, look out for the second festive episode of Call The Midwife (19:30), along with Blankety Blank (21:00) and the Brockman family reunited for one of the highlights of the schedule, Outnumbered (21:40).Elsewhere, ITV will air Pictionary (17:40) hosted by Mel Giedroyc, as many families recoil from any fall-outs of their own games at home.The network also has a special edition of The Masked Singer (19:30) and The 1% Club (21:00), while Channel 4 will broadcast The Festive Pottery Throwdown (21:00), hosted by Siobhan McSweeney.But perhaps the biggest Boxing Day release is the second season of Squid Game (Netflix), the sequel to the streamer's most watched series of all time. Many felt the original story was self-contained and that it wasn't crying out for a second season, it will be interesting to see where Netflix takes it and whether it can have the same impact. "

Rioter who featured in viral bricking video jailed,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 21:45:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp5n1qn8yo," A man who featured in a viral video of him being hit in the crotch and head by bricks during the Southport riot has been jailed.Brian Spencer was first hit in the head by a brick thrown by a fellow rioter as he goaded a line of riot police on 30 July.As he held his head, he was then hit by a second brick directly in the crotch, causing him to stagger in the street.The 40-year-old, of Lytham Road, Southport, pleaded guilty at Liverpool Crown to violent disorder and was jailed for two years and six months. The riot broke out the day after three girls were killed in a knife attack in Southport.Spencer also admitted a separate offence of racially aggravated harassment.Merseyside Police said his injuries were captured on mobile phone footage which was shared widely on social media after ""some wayward missiles"" hit him during the ""appalling scenes"" in Southport. A police spokesperson said Spencer ""could be seen acting in an aggressive manner"" as part of a large group of people who were standing in front of police officers and throwing bricks. Spencer was also seen ""punching a police vehicle several times and picking up and throwing wheelie bins"" at officers, police said.Merseyside Police said its officers were later called to hospital after injured Spencer racially abused another patient while he was receiving treatment for his head injury.A police spokesperson said the ""officers recognised him from the viral social media footage"" and he was arrested. Det Insp Paula Jones said there were ""despicable scenes as bricks, bins and other missiles were thrown"" at officers during the riot.She added: ""Spencer was involved in the violence and will now spend a significant amount of time in prison.""

Mauritius hints Chagos talks stuck over money,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 15:30:50 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj49qjypqv4o," Mauritius's deputy prime minister has hinted that negotiations with the UK over  the future of the Chagos Islands are being held up over the amount of money involved.Under the terms of the original agreement, which was announced in October, the UK would relinquish sovereignty to Mauritius over the archipelago but maintain a 99-year lease for Diego Garcia, home to a major UK-US military airbase.As part of the deal, the UK said it would provide a package of financial support to Mauritius, including annual payments and infrastructure investment, but neither side has said how much is involved.However a new government in Mauritius, elected since the agreement was first made, has said it wants to see some changes. The proposed deal has also attracted criticism in the UK, with the opposition Conservative party calling it a ""monumental failure of statecraft"".When the agreement was first made public after years of talks, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the then Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth called it a ""seminal moment in our relationship and a demonstration of our enduring commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes and the rule of law"".It sought to end decades of uncertainty and dispute over the status of the islands.New Mauritian PM sends fresh Chagos proposals to UKChagos deal remains on track, says UK ministerTrump team hostile to Chagos deal, claims FarageIn a joint statement issued on Friday, the UK and Mauritius said they were committed ""to finalising a treaty as quickly as possible"" that included both the ""secure and effective operation of the existing base on Diego Garcia and that Mauritius is sovereign over the archipelago"".They added that ""ongoing conversations"" were productive.The new Mauritian government, elected in a landslide last month, has not been explicit in public about what exactly its problems with the deal were.But talking to his constituents on Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Paul Bérenger spoke about the money involved.""This base existed on our land, on our territory... but not only it is [about] our sovereignty. There are some things you can't accept if you're a true patriot. They are trying to make us sign and they are quibbling on a small amount,"" he said.Speaking in parliament last week about the negotiations Bérenger admitted that Mauritius needs ""money to get out of the economic mess the previous government got us into, but not at any price, not under any conditions"".Addressing MPs on Friday, Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam said that the UK was keen to complete the deal ""before [Donald] Trump swears in as president on 20 January"".Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state, has described the deal as a threat to US security.Last week in the UK's House of Commons, Shadow Foreign Secretary Dame Priti Patel accused the Labour government of putting the UK's national security at risk, ignoring the interests of Chagossians, and ""letting our standing go into freefall"" in an increasingly dangerous world.""How much is the British taxpayer going to be liable for each year, and in total, over 99 years?"" she asked.Foreign Office Minister Stephen Doughty  insisted the deal would enhance, not damage UK security, saying it would protect the military base's operation and ensure it was ""on a safe footing well into the next century"".In recent years, the UK has faced rising diplomatic isolation over its claim to what it refers to as the British Indian Ocean Territory, with various United Nations bodies - including its top court and general assembly - overwhelmingly siding with Mauritius and demanding the UK surrender what some have called its ""last colony in Africa"".The government of Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the Chagos Islands away in return for its own independence from the UK in 1968.Until very recently, the UK insisted that Mauritius itself had no legitimate claim to the islands.

Morrisons apologises after discount and delivery issues,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 21:00:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjg8kz8jj3o," Morrisons has apologised after tech problems affected discounts and online deliveries across the UK.Customers were unable to redeem discounts on their loyalty cards and had Christmas deliveries postponed at short notice on Monday morning.Morrisons said it was investigating the issues in store and online but did not give any information on the causes of the outage. All stores were back to normal by Monday evening, the BBC understands.In response to the problems at the tills, the supermarket chain has applied some loyalty discounts to all customers. It is making its top 100 More Card prices the regular price for all shoppers, even if they are not members of the loyalty scheme.More Card customers will also get an extra 10% off their entire shop ""as an apology"".Both measures will be in place until the end of Tuesday, Morrisons said.Customers who shopped on Monday before the 10% discount was introduced can go back in store to redeem the discount, Morrisons said.Some home deliveries may arrive late, and click and collect customers should wait for an email before going to stores, the company said.But some customers have told the BBC their online orders - containing their Christmas Day food - have been cancelled altogether.And others have told the BBC they have experienced similar issues before today, including over the weekend and ""in the last couple of months."" One customer said he missed out on about £20 of discounts.""I added everything up as I went around the shop and it came to £70, which with all my card discounts and vouchers should have cost me nothing at the checkout,"" Steve Weatherby, from Huddersfield, told BBC News.""But it came up as £90. None of the discounts and offers around the store, like 50p off, had been applied.""So I had to pay it as I was shopping for Christmas lunch and things we needed.""He added: ""The staff were getting upset as they weren't aware of what was happening, and it's not their fault.""Another customer told the BBC her online order was cancelled on Monday morning.""I booked it ages ago, when the delivery slots first came out for Christmas,"" said Moira Gray, from Northumberland.Unable to leave the house due to illness, she added she was ""really stressed,"" as her order included turkey and trifle for Christmas Day.""[Morrisons] said they couldn't do anything... they also said their systems were down,"" she added, saying that Morrisons offered a £10 goodwill voucher.Another customer, Lorraine Calvo from Northumberland, had her delivery cancelled in the morning and said Morrisons told her this was due to a problem with the IT system.""I saw the email at 8.30am and was a bit shocked because they texted me last night confirming the delivery,"" she told the BBC.""It was all my weekly shop to get me through Christmas, and cat food and everything.""Since this story was published online, Morrisons got in touch with Ms Gray and Ms Calvo, and promised to deliver their orders on Monday, free of charge.It also disputed the claims that these cancellations were due to the main systems issue, telling the BBC that they were separate problems which were dealt with by customer services.But it did say in a statement: ""If for any reason there are isolated cancellations, our team will be in touch directly to resolve them."" Morrisons had been advertising large discounts ahead of Christmas, including some vegetables for 10p.""There's never a good time for a tech glitch, but for it to happen on what is expected to be the busiest day of the year is the stuff of nightmares,"" says retail analyst Natalie Berg.""This will further erode shopper trust and impact profitability.""Monday was predicted to be the busiest shopping day for supermarkets this year, according to retail analysts Kantar.Sales at supermarkets are expected to reach over £13bn for the first December ever.Morrisons is the fifth-largest market supermarket in the UK, according to Kantar, with 8.6% of the grocery market in the 12 weeks leading up to 1 December 2024.""Retailers are putting more and more deals through their loyalty cards and if shoppers can't access them, they will feel cheated,"" said Ronan Hegarty, news editor of trade publication The Grocer. The Morrisons website was also down for a period in the morning, with error messages on some pages suggesting invalid or late responses from servers."

"Gaetz paid 'tens of thousands' for sex and drugs, ethics report says ","Mon, 23 Dec 2024 22:07:30 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1d9pzjkno," Former Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz spent tens of thousands of dollars on sex and drugs while serving as a US congressman, according to a long-awaited report from the House of Representatives ethics committee.It follows a years-long investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use by Gaetz, who President-elect Donald Trump wanted to serve as the nation's top lawman.The committee also found evidence that Gaetz, 42, received gifts in excess of permissible amounts in connection to a 2018 trip to the Bahamas. The former lawmaker has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, saying he is the victim of a smear campaign. Amid the controversy, he withdrew from consideration to serve as US attorney general.  The congressional ethics report found that ""there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favours or privileges, and obstruction of Congress."" From 2017 to 2020, Gaetz made payments totalling more than $90,000 (£72,000) to 12 different women ""that the Committee determined were likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use"", the report found. Additionally, the report contains testimony that Gaetz paid for sex with a 17-year-old at a party in 2017, giving her $400 ""which she understood to be payment for sex"". Gaetz has denied having sex with a minor.The Department of Justice also investigated an allegation that he had sex with a minor but ultimately did not file any criminal charges against him.In a last-minute court filing on Monday, Gaetz sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the report's release. He accused the ethics committee of trying to exercise its jurisdiction over a private citizen.The committee's 42-page report accuses Gaetz of being ""uncooperative"" throughout its review, and that he would frequently ""deflect, deter, or mislead"" the panel ""in order to prevent his actions from being exposed"".Despite a subpoena, he never appeared before the committee to testify. Gaetz represented Florida's first congressional district in the US House of Representatives, having come to power in the same election in 2016 that propelled his ally Trump to the White House the first time.Gaetz got married in 2021 to his current wife, Ginger, who has supported the former Florida congressman as he's faced the allegations. She posted a photo on X of her husband with the caption ""unemployment has never looked so good"" after he withdrew his name to serve as attorney general after resigning from Congress. Gaetz was believed to be beyond the reach of the committee when he resigned from Congress last month, following his nomination by Trump to serve as US attorney general - America's top law enforcement official who heads the Department of Justice.Trump picked Gaetz in part because he is an ultra-loyalist who had also pledged to take on the ""weaponised"" legal system that supporters believe targeted Trump. He has been one of Trump's most strident defenders on Capitol Hill. But many Republicans in Congress, including those tasked with voting on such nominations, were aghast at the choice and successfully challenged it.Gaetz dropped out just eight days after being nominated by Trump amid a groundswell of controversy. Trump then tapped former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi as his nominee for attorney general. Trump has not yet commented on the report's findings.  Ethics committee votes to release reportWhat to know about the Gaetz investigationThe rise and fall of Gaetz in eight wild days While it is unusual for the committee to release its findings after a lawmaker leaves public office, the report noted that a ""majority"" of members found it was in the public interest to do so in this instance. An intense debate had erupted over whether or not the report should be released, particularly after Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration for the top justice department role.He said that he hoped to avoid a ""needlessly protracted Washington scuffle"". Gaetz's slated role as attorney general was one of those that required the confirmation of US senators, and it did not seem that he had the required support.The secretive ethics committee had investigated Gaetz on and off since 2021 - not only on the claims about sex and drugs, but also on allegations he accepted bribes and misused campaign funds. In all cases, he strongly denied any wrongdoing. House Republicans previously blocked Democratic efforts to unveil the results of the report, but two of them later voted to do so, according to CBS.On Monday, Gaetz posted on X that the committee chose to release the report close to Christmas ""and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses"".Last week, he posted that the ethics committee planed to ""post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.""He acknowledged in a previous post on X that his 30s was an era of ""working very hard - and playing hard too"".  ""It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life,"" he wrote. ""I live a different life now.""Several House Democrats criticised their former colleague and Trump for having chosen him as an ally. Rep Glenn Ivey, one of the five Democrats on the ethics committee, said the allegations against Gaetz show there's a pattern by Trump of not ""putting people in those positions who are really up to doing the job"".""President-elect Trump should have thought twice before he nominated Matt Gaetz and some of the other nominations he's made, I think would bear reconsideration as well,"" he told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.Since leaving Congress, Gaetz has signed a deal to become an anchor on One America News Network (OAN). He'll join the conservative news network in January.He has also started selling personalised video messages on the video platform Cameo."

No mains power or mobile signal: The valley 'on edge of society',"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 02:38:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4r30p63nqo," ""We have appalling roads, no street lights, no fibre broadband, no mobile phone signal, no gas, no mains water, no mains sewerage and no mains electricity."" Sam Wood is one of the 48 people living in the remote Upper Coquet valley in Northumberland, in farms and cottages dotted along a single track road winding into the Cheviot Hills, straddling the border between England and Scotland. She has campaigned for a decade to get mains power to an off-grid community she describes as ""on the edge of society"". But with a connection to mains electricity coming, this is the last Christmas the community will have to celebrate with the threat of a blackout hanging over them.  The noisy diesel generators that power their homes cost up to £10,000 a year to run, and can break down at any moment, including on Christmas Day.""We never know when it might happen, we can go months with no problems then the generator can stop working three times in a week,"" Sam says.""My husband Daniel has to go out in the dark to try and sort it and if he can't, well, I get the candles out.""  There are very few people in the country who are able to repair and service them. For now, the community relies on Claude Schiavetta, who travels from his home in Dunkeld in Scotland. ""Sometimes when I arrive, families have been without power for a week or two,"" he says. ""So they're usually very pleased to see me.""He may no longer be needed in the valley, but Claude doesn't begrudge the residents.""I'll miss them all when they get power, but it's about time,"" he says. ""Nobody should be without mains electricity in this country in this day and age.""   The valley missed out on the electrification programmes of the 20th Century because the farms were too remote, and for many years the community was told a connection would be too expensive. But when the Home Office decided it needed to supply mains electricity to three emergency telecommunication masts in the valley, an opportunity arose to connect many of the properties too. The project is being funded by the Home Office and Ministry of Defence (MoD) which owns the land. The valley is within the Northumberland National Park and its planning authority  initially wanted all the lines buried. A compromise was agreed, which will see 7.5 miles (12km) carried by poles and three miles (4.7km) run underground.Powerless: The rural community getting connected to the national gridNorthern Powergrid site team manager Matthew Brown says their aim is to have ""the least impact possible"". ""We did so many surveys, on the trees, on great crested newts, on the birds of prey and we have an on site archaeologist to make sure we don't damage anything we come across.""""I grew up in this area, we want to preserve it for future generations,"" he adds.  Scott Anderson's family has been at Linshiels for generations and although he still farms there, he and his family live in a house further down the valley which has mains electricity.Shona Anderson says there were many reasons why they moved out, but the reliance on a noisy, dirty generator was definitely one of them.  ""It would break down and sometimes we'd be without power for weeks or even months, she says, adding: ""We have had times when we went away for the weekend just to have power.""It's great to think next Christmas we should be back in here, the kids are older now but we've had some amazing times here, they've got good memories of the place."" Not everybody in the valley is getting mains electricity.Sheep farmer Megan Byatt's home is too remote to get a reliable connection.""It's a bit of a running joke that we're not getting it, but I don't begrudge my neighbours,"" she says.""I'm hoping we'll get some renewables so at least we'll get something out of it."" Upper Coquetdale is a community of fewer than 50 people, some living many miles apart, but the valley Christmas party is well attended and all the talk this year is of the new cable. ""There's still that little doubt,"" Shona says, ""but it's so nice to see the poles as you drive up the valley and you think to yourself, yes, this could actually happen."" Sam agrees: ""This is a community where we look out for each other.""If someone's in trouble, we all help, and that's happened many times.""Mains electricity won't change that, the valley will always be a very special place.""

Mum dies after hospital's 'basic failures' - report ,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 06:29:35 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq62039p2qlo," A woman died soon after the birth of her fifth child due to ""basic failures"" in her care, a report said.Laura-Jane Seaman, 36, died at Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, Essex, on 23 December 2022 following a significant peritoneal haemorrhage.A prevention of future deaths report by a coroner said the bleeding was not identified, despite Ms Seaman's repeated concerns that she was ""gushing"" - and her appeals to staff to ""not let me die"".Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust said it was improving training ""to prevent this from happening again"". Ms Seaman had been admitted to the hospital on 21 December and while the birth of her baby was uneventful, she subsequently suffered a haemorrhage that was not noticed by staff for hours - despite her having a known history of haemorrhages.Earlier this year, a coroner had found multiple ""gross failures"" by healthcare professionals and said if these had not occurred, Ms Seaman, from Witham, would not have died. Ms Seaman had been known to the Essex trust to be at high risk of postpartum hemorrhage - heavy bleeding post-birth - prior to her admission to hospital.After delivering a vaginal birth, she recovered well and was able to breastfeed her baby.She was sitting up in bed and was planning to go home after the discharge of her baby.However, two hours later she started to feel unwell and asked clinicians: ""Am I bleeding?""Her concerns were not escalated - with medical staff putting her symptoms down to dehydration, and when she lost consciousness she was simply given a biscuit.Essex coroner Sonia Hayes said in the report that Ms Seaman's maternal collapse was ""categorised by staff as a faint"" when it should have been escalated to the critical care team. Diane Sarkar, chief nursing and quality officer for Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""We extend our sincerest sympathies and condolences to the family of Laura-Jane.""Following investigations into the circumstances that led to her death, our focus has been on improving training in recognising the early signs of deterioration and escalation routes in our maternity services to prevent this from happening again.""

Wing Cdr Andy Shaw, of 29 Squadron which trains Typhoon pilots, said QRA is in ""extremely high readiness where we sit with armed aircraft 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, to protect the UK and its interests.""He said: ""It includes Christmas Day, New Year's Eve, the works. We're always there ready to go at a moment's notice.""We defend from really any threat. That can be from light aircraft, counter-terrorism type work, to a 9/11 scenario or the more traditional threat from long range aviation from Russia.""We'd look to protect the UK from any airborne threat, and that would usually start from knowing an aircraft is airborne and we don't know what it's doing. That could be simple as lost comms. We'd look to launch to investigate to find out what's going on and deal with it appropriately."" The BBC has been told pilots have to sleep in multiple layers of uniform to speed up the process of taking flight if they are called out at night.But what about staff working on the ground?""It is all happy and cheery,"" Bradley Fieldhouse, an RAF technician, said about his QRA shifts on Christmas Day after working three of the last four.""Everyone's in the same situation, everyone's away from their family so we try and make it as happy as possible.""We could be halfway through our Christmas dinner, and we get a call, that's just the way it goes unfortunately,"" the weapons specialist added.""Personally I have no kids, so although it's sad to be away from family for Christmas I know that someone's going to have a better Christmas with their kids.

Slovak PM meets Putin in unannounced Moscow visit,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 10:27:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0rn85v5kjo," Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico has made a surprise visit to Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin - becoming only the third Western leader to meet the Russian president since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago.Fico - a vocal critic of the European Union's support for Kyiv in the war - said they discussed supplies of Russian gas to Slovakia - which his country relies on.A deal with Russian gas giant Gazprom to transit energy through Ukraine to Slovakia is due to expire at the end of this year and Ukraine has signalled its intention not to renew it. Fico says Vladimir Putin has been ""wrongly demonised"" by the West. His visit marks a departure from the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy which all member states are expected to abide by.Under this framework, the EU has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions against Russia since Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Only Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban - another Putin ally - and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer have broken ranks with their EU counterparts to travel to Moscow.""Top EU officials were informed about my journey and its purpose... on Friday,"" Fico wrote on Facebook.He added that Putin had confirmed he would be willing to continue to supply gas to Slovakia, although the Slovak leader said this would be ""practically impossible"" with Ukraine refusing to renew the gas transit deal.Fico, who survived being shot earlier this year, also said he had discussed ""the possibilities of an early, peaceful end of the war"" and mutual relations between Russia and Slovakia.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters it was a ""complicated situation"", adding Russian gas is ""necessary for the normal operation"" of certain European countries' economies. Fico's visit has gone down badly with opposition parties at home and with Slovakia's neighbouring EU and Nato ally, the Czech Republic.Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said his government had secured energy independence from Russia, and he was thinking of Ukrainians who could not spend Christmas with their loved ones because of Putin.In Bratislava, Michal Simecka of Progressive Slovakia said Fico had made his country a tool for the Russian leader's propaganda and his trip was a ""disgrace for Slovakia and a betrayal of national interests"".Erik Kalinak, an MEP for Fico's Smer party, defended the prime minister's visit, saying he was merely trying to secure cheap gas imports for Slovakia. The visit was also defended by the environment minister Tomas Taraba and the far-right Slovak National Party. Russia sanctions: What impact have they had on its oil and gas exports?Watch BBC challenge Putin on his 25 years in power in Russia Slovakia and Hungary, which both depend on Russian gas, have raised concerns about the prospect of supplies being interrupted.In October 2023, when Fico became prime minister again, he ended Slovakia's military aid to Ukraine.But, he has insisted he wants to be a ""good, friendly neighbour"" to Kyiv.Fico's meeting with Putin came as the leaders of Italy, Sweden, Greece and Finland met on Sunday for a security summit.Speaking afterwards, Finland's Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said Russia was a ""permanent and dangerous threat"" to the EU.He also stressed the need for increased defence spending and support for Ukraine."
Man on X video with decommissioned rifle jailed,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 17:09:39 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyvdwjyw95o," A man who appeared in a social media video holding a decommissioned rifle and making threats to ""blow away"" the English Defence League has been jailed for more than two years.Habeeb Khan, 49, said a friend he did not want to name had posted the video, after it was filmed in his living room in Birmingham.A judge was told the video was widely shared on far-right social media accounts, gaining 1.4 million views on one extreme right-wing X account.Khan, a married father from Hickman Road in Sparkbrook, pleaded guilty to making threats of death or serious harm contrary to the Online Safety Act and was jailed for 27 months. He also admitted threatening behaviour relating to homophobic and abusive comments made after he was taken to hospital by police on the day of his arrest.The city's crown court heard a T-shirt Khan was wearing in an 11-second clip from the video was found on the washing line of his home when he was arrested on 7 August, two days after serious disorder in the Bordesley Green area.Judge Melbourne Inman KC told Khan this was ""one of a number of cases that this court has had to deal with which arise out of civil unrest which itself followed from the very tragic events in Southport"" on 29 July.That was the background to his actions on 6 August when he caused a message to be sent on X, said the judge, who stated: ""This was, as you know, a time of extremely heightened social tension. On any view you were very reckless."" The video was shared through numerous accounts on X, according to prosecutor Laurie Scott, who said the decommissioned rifle recovered by police was incapable of firing live rounds.During his arrest, the court heard, Khan said ""all I have done is make a little video"" before ""playing up"" for a crowd.

Sex message complaint about council boss last year,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:56:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdnr41209yo," Former City of Edinburgh Council leader Cammy Day was accused of sending unsolicited sexual messages almost two years ago, it has emerged. The Labour politician quit earlier this month after it was alleged he ""bombarded"" Ukrainian refugees with messages. He is being investigated by police over an allegation of inappropriate behaviour.Day, who was suspended by Labour pending the outcome of the investigation, has been asked to comment.  A Scottish Labour spokesperson said the party took all complaints seriously and that they are investigated in line with party policy. Day became leader of Edinburgh City Council in 2022. According to the Sunday Mail, the party's general secretary received a complaint from a constituent in March 2023 alleging Day had sent them ""persistent and unsolicited"" nude pictures on a dating app.The complainant said the messages made them feel ""deeply uncomfortable"". They told the party's then-general secretary, former MSP James Kelly, that they wanted Labour to speak to Day about his conduct without having to go through a formal process.The person added: ""If that means that the Labour Party will take no action against a perpetrator of sexual harassment, then that's a decision for the Labour Party.""It is understood no formal complaint was made when the allegations were referred to independent investigators. Anas Sarwar, who has been Scottish Labour leader since 2021, told the Sunday Mail he did not know about the March 2023 complaint.  He said: ""We have an independent complaints procedure so if a complaint is made to the Labour Party, the complaint does not come to me and the independent group that looks at complaints does not notify me, as leader, until there is the opening of an investigation.""As soon as evidence was shared with me - as it was by the Sunday Mail earlier this month - of alleged inappropriate behaviour, then he was suspended the same day.""Day, who remains a councillor but has been replaced as council leader by Labour's Jane Meagher, has since been the subject of fresh accusations. Two men told The Times they were sent unsolicited messages by Day on a dating app. He was accused of sending naked pictures of himself, and allegedly became aggressive if ignored.  Scottish Labour said they were not made aware of the claims made in The Times.City of Edinburgh Council said it dealt with complaints through ""established processes"" in consultation with an independent whistleblowing service and, where appropriate, Police Scotland.Police Scotland is investigating a report of inappropriate behaviour made on 22 October.The force said a previous report had been made about Day earlier this year but no criminality was established in that case."

What we know about Magdeburg market attack suspect Abdulmohsen,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 12:01:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy09y32rlnxo," A 50-year-old Saudi-born man is being held in Germany on suspicion of Friday night's car attack on hundreds of people visiting Magdeburg's Christmas market.The attack killed five people, including a nine-year-old boy and four women, and left more than 200 injured, with many in a critical condition.Police believe the suspect acted alone, but significant details have emerged about him that indicate this was a very different attack from anything Germany has seen before. Taleb al-Abdulmohsen has lived in Germany since 2006 and is described as a psychiatrist who was living about 50km (30 miles) south of Magdeburg, in the town of Bernburg.Abdulmohsen does not fit the profile of attackers who caused mass casualties at Christmas markets in Berlin in 2016 and Strasbourg in France in 2018, or more recently at a festival in Solingen in August.He is not an extreme Islamist - in fact, if you believe his social media posts and broadcast interviews, he appears to be have abandoned the faith and to have turned into an outspoken critic of Islam.The motive behind the Magdeburg attack is for now unclear, but a picture of the suspect has emerged based on his past and the various interviews he gave.He was granted asylum in 2016 and ran a website that aimed to help other former Muslims flee persecution in their Gulf homelands.German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said it was ""clear to see"" the suspect held ""Islamophobic"" views. He has also expressed sympathy on social media for Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), known for its anti-immigration stance. Eyewitness account: Witness saw car hit boyfriend in attackInvestigation ongoing: Police probe market security and warnings about suspect   As for the motive of Friday's killings in Magdeburg, Holger Münch of the federal criminal police has said it is too early to say.""He has anti-Islamic views; of course he's also been involved with extreme-right platforms and given interviews,"" he told German media. ""But drawing a conclusion between what he says and what he's done... it's not yet possible to conclude it's politically motivated.""The suspect had been on the radar of German authorities for years, and the Saudis even tipped them off in November last year. Saudi sources said four official notifications known as ""Notes Verbale"" were sent warning German authorities of his ""very extreme views"".Although Saxony-Anhalt police did investigate him, he was never considered a threat because he had exhibited no violence before. Any potential threat was judged ""too unspecific"".Magdeburg police chief Tom-Oliver Langhans said police had conducted a threat assessment, ""but that discussion was one year ago"".Authorities may have been wary of Saudi warnings. A counter-terrorism expert told the BBC the Saudis may have been mounting a disinformation campaign to discredit someone who tried to help young Saudi women seek asylum in Germany. In 2013 Abdulmohsen was fined for breaching the peace by making a series of threats, and his flat was searched by the police. Then the following year he threatened to carry out acts that would command ""international attention"" if he did not get the support he wanted, officials said. At the time he was living in northern Germany, and in 2015 he is alleged to have made threats on a hotline that he would get hold of a gun and take revenge on judges in his previous cases, reports say.By 2016 he was granted asylum apparently on the grounds of political persecution, and in recent years he has accused several people of being spies for the Saudi government, according to German reports, and was himself accused of defamation.A picture has built up of a man who studied psychiatry and then worked from 2020 in a correctional facility for criminals in Bernburg, without being very good at his job.His employer said he had been off work since October because of leave and illness, but a colleague told the local Mitteldeutsche Zeitung"" (MZ) they called him ""Dr Google"" because he always had to check his diagnosis online first.In the meantime he was active on social media, promoting conspiracy theories regarding an alleged plot by German authorities to Islamicise Europe, and re-tweeting posts from the leader of the AfD and a far-right activist.He maintained a website designed to help ex-Muslims flee the Gulf region. It carries the message in English as well as Arabic: ""My advice: do not seek asylum in Germany."" He gave several interviews, including to the BBC and most recently German news magazine Die Zeit last year. The man who interviewed him, Christian Fuchs, said it was clear he no longer trusted the authorities and ""had a manic personality"".Nancy Faeser told German newspaper Bild that investigators would examine ""in detail"" what information authorities had on Abdulmohsen in the past and how he had been investigated.The German Office for Migration and Refugees announced in a post on social media that it had fielded a complaint about the suspect, which it had ""taken seriously"", but as the office was not an investigative body, it had referred the complainant to other authorities. At 19:02 on Friday evening (18:02 GMT), the first call to emergency services was made. The caller reported that a car had driven into a crowd at a Christmas market in the middle of Magdeburg.The caller assumed it was an accident, police said, but it soon became clear this was not the case.The driver, police said, had used traffic lights to turn off the road and on to a pedestrian crossing, leading him through an entry point to the market which was reserved for emergency vehicles, injuring a number of people on the way.Footage showed the driver speeding the vehicle through a pedestrian walkway between Christmas stalls.Eyewitnesses described jumping out of the car's path, fleeing or hiding.Police said the driver then returned to the road the way he came in and was forced to stop in traffic. Officers already at the market were able to apprehend and arrest the driver here. Footage showed armed police confronting and arresting a man who can be seen lying on the ground next to a stationary vehicle - a black BMW with significant damage to its front bumper and windscreen.The entire incident was over in three minutes, police said. A nine-year-old boy, André Gleissner, and four women aged 45, 52, 67 and 75 are confirmed to have died in the attack. More than 200 people were injured and at least 41 of those are in a critical condition.The Schöppenstedt fire department paid tribute to Gleissner, in a Facebook post.The fire department said the nine-year-old was a member of the children's fire brigade in Warle – about an hour's drive from Magdeburg."
Souvenir hunter returns loco part nicked in 1980s,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 06:20:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dxz9jdz56o," Part of a steam locomotive has finally been returned by a ""souvenir hunter"" who admitted pinching it in the 1980s.The Nene Valley Railway (NVR), near Peterborough, received a mysterious letter from a ""reformed and repentant former 1980s schoolboy souvenir hunter"", alongside the missing part - a handle - and a £10 donation. The handle was originally on the smokebox door of a small locomotive built in the the 1920s called ""Derek Crouch"", which has been overhauled and repaired.Nathan Wilson, an NVR engineer, thanked the anonymous loco-part thief - who began his letter ""Merry  Christmas"" - for sending it back.  The tasks carried out by Hudswell Clarke 0-6-0ST No.1539 ""Derek Crouch"" during its decades in service included working at Tilbury Docks in Essex and transporting freight from farms and factories on the Wissington Light Railway in Norfolk.The NVR team had been searching for the missing piece for decades, but said whoever took it may have done them a favour. If they had not kept such good care of it, the part could have been damaged, or lost.Mr Wilson told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: ""It is fantastic, it gave me a really good laugh when the letter appeared on the desk. ""We know nothing about who it was from, but we are grateful they looked after it and returned it to us. ""We have got no hard feelings. ""I've been involved in looking after the engine for about 12 years now and we have never had it... we presumed it was long gone.""The letter from the culprit began: ""... yes it is your original, I'm afraid you lost it in the 1980s.""It concluded: ""Good luck with your restoration, please find enclosed a small additional contribution.""

Two jailed for role in £42m cocaine smuggling plot,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 17:17:43 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynzkqp4qpo," Two men involved in one of the UK's biggest ever drugs seizures have been jailed.More than half a tonne (524kg) of cocaine with a street value of more than £42m was landed by boat in Easington on the East Yorkshire coast in May.The gang was intercepted in a pub car park by National Crime Agency (NCA) officers who discovered the narcotics in the back of a hire van.Mark Moran, 22, was sent to prison for 15 years and Daniel Livingstone, 25, was jailed for seven years and nine months at Hull Crown Court. The court heard the defendants had bought an inflatable boat which they used to pick up a consignment of drugs in the North Sea.They landed the cocaine at a caravan site before driving to stay overnight at a local pub, where they were arrested.Prosecutor Angus MacDonald told the court the drugs were of a very high purity of ""86-89%"" and was ""one of the largest seizures"".In mitigation, Moran's barrister Derek Duffy said his client played a minor role and the whole operation was ""cartel organised from South America"".""His job was to get the drugs from the boat to the shore,"" Mr Duffy said.Livingstone's lawyer Michael Forest said he drove the van to pick up the drugs and had been offered £40,000 for his role.""He was in debt and it offered a way out,"" Mr Forest said.""The lure of easy money led him down this dark path."" Passing sentence, Judge Mark Bury said he was ""bewildered"" how the men from rural Scotland with no previous criminal convictions had become part of the gang.""It's puzzling to try and work out how you became involved,"" the judge said.At a trial in October, Moran of Glenfyne Terrace, Ardrishaig was found guilty of conspiracy to import cocaine.Livingstone, of Calton Avenue, Campbeltown, pleaded guilty to the same charge.Colombian national Didier Tordecilla Reyes, 39, who pleaded guilty to importing cocaine, will be sentenced at a later date.Another defendant Anthony McAllister, 33, of Aldersyde in Taynuilt, Scotland, was found not guilty on all the charges he faced. Alan French from the NCA said: ""There's no doubt these drugs would have been sold into communities around the UK.""But working with our partners including Humberside Police and Border Force, we have disrupted this crime group's offending and made a huge dent in any profits they were due to make.""Listen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here."
'Beloved' puffins in Repair Shop makeover,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 06:08:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly4lgq5j7go," A pair of puffins that stand guard outside a bookshop have been restored by the team at the BBC's Repair Shop after the owners asked for their help.One fibreglass puffin has stood outside The Book House in Thame, Oxfordshire, for more than 50 years.Luise Pattinson, who runs the shop with brother-in-law Brian Pattinson, said the puffin was ""beloved of many throughout the generations"" and with the help of local residents they were able to send photos and memories to the programme makers.She said it was ""like all our Christmases have come early"". Fat Puffin, who measures more than 1m high (3.2ft), was gifted to the shop by Puffin Books in 1972, as it was one of the few children's bookstores in the country.But his condition deteriorated over the years through wear and tear, being knocked over, and a kidnapping by students in 1984, which left him dangling from the town hall by a rope.A fellow puffin called Muffin joined him outside the shop much later, but she was lighter and frequently blown down the street in moderate winds. Ms Pattinson said she was taken by surprise when The Repair Shop call came.""I was away for the weekend and in an aquarium and emerged from the shark tank to a missed call,"" she explained.""Luckily I rang back and it was one of the producers to say our application had got through the first couple of stages and she wanted to talk some more.""After arrangements were made, an ""unmarked van appeared outside the shop"" and the ""puffins were bundled in"".She added: ""A young man legged it across the road to me and said 'what have you done with the puffins? I can't believe it, have I just seen the end of The Book House puffins? Are you throwing them out? This is an outrage.'""And I said 'no, no, no, they're on their way to get fixed and have a spa day'."" The puffins have now been renovated and returned to their rightful place outside the shop.""Even though I've been a fan of the show since the first episode I could not have imagined the amazing job they did,"" Ms Pattinson said.After the makeover the puffins even have plinths with wheels so they can be rolled along to prevent further wear and tear.""No more lugging them in and out of the shop,"" Ms Patterson explained. ""We wheel them in and out... on the shop floor it's like an episode from Strictly [Come Dancing]. They glide and they swirl."" Mr Pattinson said: ""People who have been coming to the shop on a regular basis, they just love this new look that they have. ""They look resplendent in their new paint and colours and we're absolutely thrilled with them.""Ms Pattinson added: ""The puffins are back and they're going to be back for the next 50 years, and they're shiny and wonderful and joyous.""The Repair Shop at Christmas is broadcast later on BBC One at 20:15.

Trafalgar Square menorah dismantled due to wind,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 06:14:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27d8dq0jyo," High winds over the weekend forced the removal of Trafalgar Square's giant menorah, altering plans for the first night of Hanukkah celebrations, City Hall has said.The menorah, a longstanding symbol of London's Hanukkah festivities, could not be safely reinstalled in time for Wednesday's event, according to the Jewish Leadership Council (JLC) and Greater London Authority.A smaller 12ft (3.7m) tall menorah and a projection of ""Happy Hanukkah"" on Nelson's Column will instead mark the beginning of the holiday, also called the Festival of Light.The JLC said it was proud the menorah would stand alongside Trafalgar Square's Christmas tree as ""a symbol of London's religious diversity"". This year Hanukkah runs from 25 December until 2 January. London mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed the holiday amid ""difficult times"" in the Middle East, while also condemning the rising number of incidents of antisemitism recorded across the capital.He said: ""The story of [Hanukkah] is one of light and hope winning out in the darkest of times and re-dedication to the values we hold dear, even in the face of overwhelming adversity.""I stand with our Jewish communities today and all days to say that antisemitism has absolutely no place in our city.""A JLC spokesperson added the menorah would act as a ""powerful symbol of Jewish pride"" in response to antisemitism.

Soweto's 'Lion King' on his return for Mufasa,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:57:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0ewxwy47vvo," South African composer Lebo M, renowned for creating the distinctive opening chant of The Lion King's Circle of Life, rose from his life in exile in the US to legendary status and is now back with his signature sound for the latest instalment in the franchise, Mufasa.His unforgettable Zulu cry, ""Nants ingonyama, bagithi Baba"", meaning ""here comes a lion, father"", is a stand-out moment in the original film.Now, he is bringing his signature sound to Mufasa with a new song. Directed by Barry Jenkins, the film serves as a prequel, exploring orphaned Mufasa's journey as he faces hardships and tries to find his place in the world. The story resonates with Lebo M's own life. Born in 1964, at the height of apartheid, the racist system of oppression in South Africa, he grew up in Soweto, a black township on the outskirts of Johannesburg.He told the BBC Africa Daily podcast that he came from ""the poorest neighbourhood and the poorest family"".Listen to the Lebo M interview on Africa Daily podcastBut despite the circumstances he was born into, his talent and love for singing was apparent. In 1979, at 16, he was forced into exile after travelling to neighbouring Lesotho to perform. He had gone without an ID or passport and was denied re-entry to South Africa. He settled in Lesotho for a while before moving to the US to attend school and later settled in Los Angeles.This is where his career skyrocketed and his Lion King journey began. Lebo M said he is proud he contributed to a project like the Lion King,  ""that represents Africa in the highest quality"" and considers it one of his great successes. But despite being a ""major part of the original DNA"" of The Lion King by conceptualising and composing the music, Lebo M feels he has not received as much financial success from it as some of his peers, largely due to his background.""I'm forever a refugee, I'm forever an immigrant from Africa even in the business room,"" he told the BBC. He said at the time he did not have lawyers to ensure he got his fair share. Even now, three decades deep into his career, Lebo M said he  often finds he is the only black person in the room. ""I don't think it's because of tokenism,"" he explained, adding that his experience speaks for itself. In addition to working on The Lion King franchise, he has also composed music for The Woman King, The Power of One, and Congo.""I don't feel unwelcome, I don't feel intimidated, I don't feel like I don't belong. But I know if I didn't do what I do I wouldn't be in that setting,"" he said. Despite growing up under apartheid, and being affected by racist ideology, he said he never experienced direct racism until he got to the US. ""I was born into apartheid. That means, I don't know what it is like to be in a 'multiracial environment' until I got to America,"" he said.Now 64, Lebo M reflects on his legacy and the lessons he learned from the musical legends he met during his exile, like Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba - two pillars of South Africa's musical history.He shared that despite their immense success, their financial legacy did not match their global stature, especially toward the end of their lives. This is a common thread among many African musicians who, unfortunately, died poor. Although he has learned from their mistakes, he acknowledges that success is not just about commercial gain, but about ""personal fulfilment,"" which he has found with the Lion King.

Young staff have 'different outlook' - NHS boss,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 06:18:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7rk3jd2rjo," An NHS boss says the health service needs to ""encourage and motivate"" its younger workers to prevent them from leaving early.Hannah Coffey, chief executive of North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust, says more than half of the NHS workforce is now millennial-age or younger, meaning they are in their 20s, 30s and early 40s.""They just have a very different outlook on life, for understandable reasons,"" Ms Coffey told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.The trust, which runs Peterborough City, Hinchingbrooke and Stamford and Rutland hospitals, manages the acute care of about 850,000 people and employs 7,400 members of staff. Ms Coffey said future generations ""actually get a bad press"" but urged NHS bosses to ""really genuinely understand what motivates the workforce of the future"".She said medical students paid tens of thousands of pounds to train but many left  in their second year of practicing, with similar patterns in nursing training.""That says something about not just the NHS, but things that we need to do to encourage and motivate the generation of the future,"" she said. Ms Coffey, who took up the post last year, said she wanted to create an environment where staff felt listened to, and observed that younger workers did not tend to hold back.""Our younger staff have no problem telling me what they think about the organisation,"" she said.""I spend a lot of time out and about and they tell me, and that's great.""She said Christmas was often the ""most challenging"" time of the year for staff, but added that there were plenty of things to look forward to.A new treatment centre is due to open at Stamford and Rutland in the spring, with two wards also being built at Peterborough City Hospital.There are plans for a new hospital at Hinchingbrooke by 2030, where the existing building has structural issues relating to concrete panels used in some of its walls and roof.""It's very exciting,"" said Ms Coffey.""Building a new hospital is a real responsibility – it's not just an asset for the health service, but an asset for the whole community.""

Family shares horror story of buying a puppy online,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 18:38:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp83zg9ll7zo," A family have shared their horror story about buying a new puppy online. Karen, who bought the puppy for her mum, told the BBC they paid £650 for a Yorkshire Terrier, whom they called Tiny.She said Tiny would not eat any food and began having seizures two and a half weeks of being brought to them.Animal welfare charity USPCA said there was little to no regulation on online social media platforms, so it is was really important to do research in advance and buy from someone reputable. The family from Banbridge sourced their new pet from the online marketplace Gumtree in November, despite not having used it before to purchase an animal.They got in touch with a seller from who was advertising a number of Yorkshire Terrier pups.Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme, Karen said she had asked to see the mother and pups, but the seller was not ""forthcoming"".""He insisted that he would come to us, and call in with the pup,"" she said.""Within a few hours the pup arrived.""At the time of the purchase, the puppy was nine weeks old and had not been chipped.Karen claims the seller told her the dog had been weaned off the mother but the seller did not recommend which food the dog should be given - which Karen said in hindsight was ""another red flag"".She explained that Tiny began having seizures.""We contacted the out-of-hours vets and they were fantastic, but a few days later she took another seizure,"" she said,""My sister then took the pup to the vet but it was diagnosed with a liver condition and would need a liver shunt.""But the vet didn't believe Tiny would survive the operation and we had to put her to sleep.""Karen said they were telling their story to raise awareness and to prevent another family going through the same ordeal. In April 2022, Gumtree Ireland placed a ban on the sale and advertising of dogs to fight the illegal practice of breeding. This does not apply to Gumtree UK. A spokesperson for Gumtree UK said: ""We have invested in a dedicated safety team, who constantly monitor the site to ensure that our rules for listings are upheld by prospective sellers. ""We also work with industry leading partners, including the Pets Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG)… to ensure we comply with best practice industry standards that improve animal welfare in an ecommerce environment."" Nora Smith, chief executive officer of the USPCA, said: ""It's absolutely heartbreaking and unfortunately Karen's story is just one of many that the USPCA regularly hear of""Christmas is the season for impulse purchases, and unfortunately many people do elect to buy pets but from our perspective it's a cliche for a reason, pets don't belong under the Christmas tree, they're not toys."" The Department of Agriculture said it was working to ban third party sale of puppies and kittens in Northern Ireland.In the meantime, Ms Smith said there were a number of checks the USPCA would advise the public to complete, including:Checking if they are a licensed, reputable breederVisiting the breeder facility in-personChecking the puppy's health records such as its vaccination and worming certificatesClarifying if the puppy is at least eight weeks old before it is taken away from its motherAsking about the background of the puppySpeaking to the breeder about the history of the puppy's mother such as how many litters she has had and how her health isAny concerns or worries about a puppy or kitten breeder should be reported to the local council or the USPCA."

Plans for sheep and cow sculptures approved,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 20:07:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgx82rl4r6o," Plans for a series of animal sculptures celebrating Spalding's historic livestock market have been approved.The proposals, put forward by Spalding and District Civic Society and local arts group Transported Art, were approved by South Holland District Council at a meeting last week.Six white sheep, carved from limestone, will be sited in the pedestrianised area of the Sheep Market, along with a single carved black sheep nearby.A bull and a cow, based on the Lincoln Red cattle breed, will be placed on a plinth on New Road where weekly cattle auctions were held until 1938. Nick Jones from Transported Art previously said the trail would help create a ""sense of belonging"" to people in Spalding.""People want to know more about the history of where they live so they can feel a sense of belonging and pride,"" Mr Jones said.A spokesperson for Spalding and District Civic Society said the trail would celebrate the various livestock markets that took place in Spalding, as well as the continuing important role South Holland plays in the nation's food supply.The initiative could also potentially boost local tourism and footfall in the town centre, they added.The artwork, by Leicestershire-based sculptor Graeme Mitcheson, are due to be unveiled in the early spring, with additional sculptures planned in the future, the group said.

Police issue warning over rising doorstep crime,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 13:00:52 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7rvmxe2k0o," Doorstep scammers are targeting elderly and vulnerable residents, Surrey Police have warned. The force said it had seen an increase in incidents of doorstep crime, partly due to recent storms. It explained that rogue traders had exploited the bad weather to cold-call residents and offer to undertake often unnecessary work on their homes, which was then carried out at a low standard or inflated cost - if at all. The force said it had received 155 reports from vulnerable victims in Surrey and Sussex over the last three months, with a total recorded loss of £980,640.  Woking Police sergeant Ryan Scott said people ""generally"" being targeted were elderly women who lived alone in ""well-off"" areas. He said the crime had a ""massive emotional and mental impact"" on victims - at times, causing them to lose trust in the community - as well as the financial cost. ""Unfortunately, we have had some victims pass away, possibly through stress, a couple of weeks after these incidents,"" Mr Scott added. He suggested offences were likely to be underreported to police as victims felt embarrassed.  Surrey Police described how one elderly resident in Sussex was cold-called at their home by rogue traders. They agreed to fix a single loose roof tile but claimed more work needed doing and tried to charge 10 times the original price after only 30 minutes of extra work. Despite feeling under pressure and intimidated, the would-be victim refused to pay and contacted officers instead, according to the force. Mr Scott urged anyone who felt they had been the victim of doorstop crime to contact the police or trading standards. ""It's so prevalent,"" he said. ""The way these people work is they are so convincing. They will confuse you and convince you. There's no need to feel embarrassed at all."" Follow BBC Surrey on Facebook and X.

Police achieve 999 target for first time,"Tue, 24 Dec 2024 06:15:44 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7r6kvp382o," Wiltshire Police has hit the national target for 999 answer rates for the first time.Each month the force takes an average of 8,000 emergency calls. In November, it answered more than 90% of them in under 10 seconds, which is the national target.This is a huge improvement from March, when it ranked as the worst force in the country.Ch Insp Al Lumley, said the department continued to ""push forwards"" to improve further in 2025. Answer rates for 999 calls are recorded monthly and shared with every police force across the country.""It's not a league table but we use it to compare ourselves against other forces,"" said Ch Insp Lumley.In March, Wiltshire Police was ranked 44th - the worst in the country, in November it reached 21st.""We're not happy with being average, our focus hasn't stopped,"" he added. A new project analysing demand and the latest cohort of new call operators was expected to see the force ""go up that table even more"" in 2025, he said.Ch Insp Lumley said: ""The amount of responsibility they have and the amount of hats they have to wear is astronomical.""Answering 999 calls is about 50% of a call operator's job, building flex into the system is credited with helping the force to improve.""When demand is outstripping capacity, the room will flex,"" Ch Insp Lumley said.""They'll (call operators) stop what they're doing, take on new responsibilities to meet that demand."" Technology, recruitment, training and improvements in ""empathy fatigue"" have also helped rates to improve.Ch Insp Lumley said: ""Whenever there's a sentencing for a serious crime we go back to the initial call taker to say, 'You achieved this'.""It helps makes sure the operators here are continually reminded that every caller (is experiencing) the most significant moment of their life, and so the operator's able to give them their best possible service."" Shannon Hibbert, 19, has been a call handler for 12-months and has seen the changes first-hand.""For some people it was quite a low point to know we were at that bottom, (of the table),"" he said.""For others it gave us motivation to do better and build our way back up"".Her first solo call was a domestic incident.""It's scary, but there's such an adrenaline rush and you feel quite proud that you can help someone"" she said.""Everyday is different and that's what I love most about this job. The good days really stick with you."" Follow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to us on email or via WhatsApp on 0800 313 4630."
'I could have lost my life in e-scooter accident',"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 15:22:30 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8x78l2rmyo," A mum who was left with broken bones and a ""shattered leg"" after she fell from an e-scooter has urged parents not to buy one for their children for Christmas.Lauren Mullen was riding her 13-year-old son's e-scooter along Marjorie Road, in Chaddesden, Derby, on 31 October when she fell off and ""smashed"" her leg on to the kerb.The 44-year-old spent five weeks in hospital recovering and said the incident nearly led to her leg being amputated. She said: ""Please don't get one for your children, they are death traps and I would never get on one again."" Ms Mullen said she was unsure what caused her to fall from the e-scooter. ""It was either a pothole or a pebble"", she said.""I have had seven operations and two blood transfusions since the accident. ""I had to have an emergency operation due to blood pooling in my leg, and I could have lost my leg or my life. Paramedics said my heart could have stopped because of the trauma.""Ms Mullen said it would be 18 months until she recovered fully.She added: ""I can't believe falling off an e-scooter has warranted the injuries I have sustained, I could have lost my leg or my life."" E-scooters cannot be insured, which makes it unlawful to ride them on roads, cycle lanes or pavements in the UK.When asked if she was aware that riding an e-scooter on public land was illegal, Ms Mullen said: ""I was not.""Since the start of November, Derbyshire Police seized e-scooters ""immediately"" off the streets if they were seen by officers in public places.""The e-scooter will never be ridden again"", said Ms Mullen. ""My son has seen what it has done to me, so I think he is now well aware of the dangers, he will not be riding it again.""They are not toys and I didn't foresee the dangers, not for one minute. ""The injury it has caused is unbelievable, I don't know what would have happened if my 13 year-old son had an accident."" Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

Magdeburg attack offers far right fertile ground despite suspect's backing for AfD,"Mon, 23 Dec 2024 15:45:40 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynzk8n717o," ""I feel bad, I still do,"" said Eidwicht, as she stood in the Christmas market close to the spot where the car sped through on Friday, killing five people and injuring more than two hundred others.""My granddaughter was here. I rang her because my daughter told me that something had happened here. And she didn't answer for two hours.""There is deep sadness here - and anger directed at the government and migrants. ""It can't go on like this,"" said Eidwicht.A Saudi refugee aged 50 has been arrested for the attack but the motive is unknown.Officials say Taleb Al-Abdulmohsen, was an ""untypical"" attacker. Germany's Christmas markets and festivals have come under attack before, mainly from extreme Islamists.He has been described as critical of Islam and he also voiced support on social media for the far-right Alternative for Germany party, hailing the party for fighting the same enemy as him ""to protect Germany"". The AfD has not commented on those posts. The party held a rally in Magdeburg later on Monday where co-leader Alice Weidel called for change ""so we can finally live once again in security"". The crowd responded with calls of ""deport them"" according to news agencies.Her party is currently riding high in the opinion polls ahead of federal elections on 23 February, especially in states like Saxony-Anhalt in the former East Germany.This attack has brought two big elections issues to the fore, security and immigration, and AfD figures have highlighted both since the attack.Despite the suspect's many statements expressing hostility to Islam, the head of the AfD in Sachsen-Anhalt, Martin Reichardt, said in a statement ""the attack in Magdeburg shows that Germany is being drawn into political and religious fanaticism that has its origins in another world"".In a post on X, Weidel said the government's discussion of new security laws following the attack ""must not distract from the fact that Magdeburg would not have been possible without uncontrolled immigration. The state must protect its citizens through a restrictive migration policy and consistent deportations!"" A counter-demonstration also took place, with anti-racism groups accusing the AfD of exploiting the attack.David Begrich from Miteinander e.V. said people in the city needed a chance to catch their breath.""In the migrant communities, there is great concern about being made into a scapegoat,"" he said. ""We don't want that. We want to organise solidarity across society, but at the same time we are also sensitive to the voices of those who are now reacting with fear and uncertainty.""German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made a plea for national unity, saying ""a dark shadow hangs over this Christmas"".""Hatred and violence must not have the final word. Let's not allow ourselves to be driven apart. Let's stand together!"" he said.Germans are asking how the attack could have happened, when security was already heightened at Christmas markets and when authorities had clearly investigated the suspect several times in recent years.The threat he posed was considered ""too unspecific"", according to one assessment, while one tip-off against him in September 2023 appears to have fallen through the cracks. In another apparent security failing, the driver was also able to get through a gap that had been left open for emergency access when it should have been filled by a police van.Stallholders at the Christmas market have now been allowed to come back, to throw away old food and remove their equipment and stocks.None that I approached wanted to speak to the BBC. It's all too raw.There has also been hostility towards journalists over the past few days, especially after some 2,000 people joined a protest by the far right in Magdeburg on Saturday night.The Association of German Journalists said there had been aggression and threats against the press and appealed for greater police protection.The BBC team joined mourners gathered in Cathedral Square for a live stream of the vigil for victims of the attack and many who spoke to them said it was important to show solidarity at a time of terrible distress.But one woman struck a note of caution. There are ""some Nazis here, who don't like journalists,"" she said. ""Please be careful."""
